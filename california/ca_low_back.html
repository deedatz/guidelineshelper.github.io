<br>
General Approach and Basic Principles<br>
Low back complaints that may be work related are the most common problems
presented to occupational health and primary care providers. They are the
most common cause of reported occupational complaints and workers’ compensation
claims. These complaints account for about 30% of both cases
reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and workers’ compensation claims.
They are disproportionately expensive, accounting for 30-40% of costs as well.<br>
Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with potentially workrelated
low back problems (i.e., activity limitations due to symptoms in the
low back of less than three months duration) are presented in this clinical
practice guideline. Topics include the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients
with acute and subacute low back complaints that are potentially work
related, identification of red flags that may indicate the presence of a serious
underlying medical condition, initial management, diagnostic considerations
and special studies to identify clinical pathology, work-relatedness, modified
duty and activity, and return to work as well as further management considerations,
including the management of delayed recovery.<br>
Algorithms for patient management are included. This chapter’s master
algorithm schematizes how primary care and occupational medicine practitioners
generally can manage acute or subacute low back complaints. The
following text, tables, and numbered algorithms expand upon the master
algorithm.<br>
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with
low back complaints are as follows:<br>
The initial assessment of patients with low back problems focuses on
detecting indications of potentially serious disease, termed red flags.<br>
In the absence of red flags, imaging and other tests are not usually
helpful during the first four to six weeks of low back symptoms.<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by nonprescription
medication or an appropriately selected nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID), appropriate adjustment of activity, and
use of thermal modalities such as ice and/or heat.<br>
Primary care or occupational physicians can effectively manage acute
and subacute low back problems conservatively in the absence of red
flags.<br>
To avoid undue back irritation and debilitation from inactivity, some
activity or job modification may be helpful in the acute period. Most
patients will not require bed rest. Bed rest may lead to a slower recovery
and result in longer periods of sick leave. Bed rest has potential debilitating
effects, and its efficacy in treating acute low back pain is unproven.
Maintaining ordinary activity, as tolerated, leads to the most
rapid recovery.<br>
Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started after the first two
weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation. Careful stretching exercises
within the normal range of motion may be helpful to avoid further
restriction of motion. Exercises to strengthen low back and abdominal
muscles are commonly delayed for several weeks, but early stage lumbar
stabilization exercises can be used without aggravation of symptoms.<br>
Encourage patients recovering from acute and subacute low back problems
to return to modified- or full-duty work as soon as possible.
Having patients continue their normal activities, within limits permitted
by pain, leads to more rapid recovery than either bed rest or backmobilizing
exercises.<br>
The strongest medical evidence regarding potential therapies for low
back pain indicates that having the patient return to normal activities
has the best long-term outcome. Many invasive and noninvasive therapies
are intended to cure the pain, but no strong evidence exists that
they accomplish this as successfully as therapies that focus on restoring
functional ability without focusing on the pain. In these cases, the
traditional medical model of ‘‘curing’’ the patient does not work well.
Furthermore, the patient should be aware that returning to normal
activities most often aids recovery. Patients should be encouraged to
accept responsibility for their recovery rather than expecting the provider
to provide an easy ‘‘cure.’’ This process will promote using
activity rather than pain as a guide, and it will make the treatment
goal of return to work more obvious in the occupational setting.<br>
If symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated.<br>
Within the first three months of low back symptoms, only patients with
evidence of severe spinal disease or severe, debilitating symptoms, and
physiologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise, confirmed by
appropriate imaging studies, can be expected to benefit from surgery.<br>
More than 80% of patients with symptoms of lumbosacral nerve root
irritation due to herniated disks (nucleus pulposus) eventually recover
with or without surgery.<br>
Nonphysical factors (such as psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems) can be investigated and addressed in cases of delayed
recovery or return to work.<br>
Clinicians can greatly improve the patient’s response to back symptoms
by providing assurance, encouraging activity, and emphasizing that
more than 90% of low back pain complaints resolve without any specific
therapies. While patients may be looking for a clear-cut diagnosis for
their low back pain, the risk to them of a suggested ‘‘cure’’ for this
assumed diagnosis may be worse than their symptoms.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Assessment<br>
Thorough medical and work histories and a focused physical examination (see
Chapter 2) are sufficient for the initial assessment of a patient complaining
of potentially work-related low back symptoms. In this assessment, certain
findings, referred to as red flags, raise suspicion of serious underlying medical
conditions (Table 12-1). Their absence rules out the need for special studies,
referral, or inpatient care during the first four weeks, during which time
spontaneous recovery is expected (provided any associated workplace factors
are mitigated). Findings of the medical history and physical examination may
also alert the clinician to other pathology (not of low back origin) that can
present as low back complaints. Low back complaints can then be classified into
one of three working categories, although common factors may be operative in
all three and, thus, confound this classification:<br>
Potentially serious low back disorders, including acute fractures, acute
dislocations, infection, tumor, progressive neurologic deficit, or cauda
equina syndrome<br>
Degenerative disorders, including consequences of aging or repetitive
use, or a combination thereof, such as degenerative disk disease and
osteoarthritis<br>
Nonspecific disorders, including benign, self-limited disorders with
unclear etiology, such as regional low back pain<br>
<br>

Medical History<br>
Asking the patient open-ended questions, such as those listed below, allows
the clinician to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries to
obtain more detailed information (see also Chapter 2).<br>
WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU DOING WHEN
SYMPTOMS BEGAN?<br>
(It is important to obtain all information necessary to document the biomechanical
forces of injury.)<br>
Did symptoms develop immediately, gradually, or after a period of
delay?<br>
WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?<br>
Do you have pain, numbness, weakness, stiffness?<br>
For traumatic injuries:Was the area deformed? Did you lose any blood
or have an open wound?<br>
Is the discomfort located primarily in your low back? Do you have
pain or other symptoms elsewhere?<br>
Have you lost control of your bowel or bladder? Are you soiling your
undergarments?<br>
Do you have fever, night sweats, or weight loss?<br>
When did your symptoms begin? Have you ever had symptoms like
this before? Are your symptoms constant or intermittent? What makes
the problem worse or better?<br>
What is the day pattern to your pain? Better in the morning or evening?
Worse as the day progresses? Do you have a problem sleeping? What
position is most comfortable? Is there any pain with cough, sneezing,
deep breathing, or laughing?<br>
How do these symptoms limit you?<br>
How long can you sit, stand, walk, bend?<br>
Can you lift? How much weight (use items such as gallons of milk,
groceries, etc. as examples)?<br>
Does your pain prevent you from sleeping?<br>
WHEN DID YOUR CURRENT LIMITATIONS BEGIN?<br>
WAS THERE A SPECIFIC INCITING EVENT? HOW DID
THE LIMITATIONS DEVELOP?<br>
How long have your activities been limited? More than four weeks?<br>
Have your symptoms changed? How?<br>
Have you had similar episodes previously?<br>
Have you had previous testing or treatment? With whom?<br>
What do you think caused the problem? How do you think it is related
to work?<br>
What are your specific job duties? How long do you spend performing
each duty on a daily basis?<br>
What other activities (hobbies, workouts, sports) do you engage in?
At home or elsewhere? Do you use your back to perform them? Any
heavy lifting? How? How often?<br>
Do you have other medical problems?<br>
What do you hope we can accomplish during this visit?<br>
<br>
Determining whether or not there is lumbosacral nerve root compromise (and
if so, the level of compromise) is critical. Symptoms correlating with specific
dermatomal levels of compression and possible motor weakness are shown in

<br>

Physical Examination<br>
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination includes:<br>
General observation of the patient, including stance and gait<br>
Regional examination of the low back<br>
Examination of organ systems related to appropriate differential diagnosis<br>
Neurologic screening<br>
Testing for lumbosacral nerve root tension<br>
Monitoring pain behavior during range-of-motion and while seated
as a clue to origin of the problem<br>
<br>
The objective parts of the low back examination are testing reflexes and
circumferential measurements for atrophy. All other findings require the patient’s
cooperation. Patients who present with a complaint of leg pain may,
in fact, have a disorder of the low back.<br>
<br>
A. Observation and Regional Back Examination<br>
Observing the patient’s stance and gait is useful to guide the regional low
back examination. Incoordination or abnormal use of the extremities may
indicate the need for specific neurologic testing. Severe guarding of low-back
motion in all planes may add credence to a suspected diagnosis of spinal or
intrathecal infection, tumor, or fracture. However, because of the marked
variation among persons with symptoms and those without, range-of-motion
measurements of the low back are of limited value.<br>
Vertebral point tenderness to palpation, when associated with other signs
or symptoms, is suggestive but not specific for spinal fracture or infection.
Palpable soft-tissue tenderness, by itself, is an even less specific, less reliable
finding.<br>
<br>
B. Neurologic Screening<br>
The neurologic examination focuses on a few tests that reveal evidence of
nerve root impairment, peripheral neuropathy, or spinal cord dysfunction.
Most herniated disks in the lumbar spine involve the L5 nerve root (L4-5
disk) and the S1 nerve root (L5-S1 disk). The clinical features of lumbosacral
nerve root compression are summarized in Table 12-3.<br>
<br>
1. TESTING FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH<br>
There are no specific muscle tests for the L1 to L3 nerve roots. The iliopsoas,
the main flexor of the hip, is innervated by L1, L2, and L3 and is tested by
asking the patient to flex the hip against resistance. The L4 nerve root can
best be tested by evaluating the strength of ankle inversion and the strength
of the quadriceps, which also is innervated by L2 and L3. The L5 nerve root,
when compromised, may cause weakness of the great toe extensor on the
affected side. In severe cases, the ankle dorsiflexors also may be weak and, if
so, the patient will have foot drop during gait. The S1 root generally supplies
the plantar flexors of the foot and ankle, but motor weakness is harder to
detect due to the bulk and normal strength of these muscles (gastrocnemius,
soleus). The recommended test to detect S1 root compromise is repeated toe
raises. Hamstring weakness may also be detected by this test.<br>
<br>
2. CIRCUMFERENTIAL MEASUREMENTS<br>
Muscle atrophy can be detected by bilateral circumferential measurements of
the calf and thigh. Differences of less than 2 centimeters in measurement of
the two limbs at the same level can be a normal variation. Symmetric muscle
bulk and strength are expected unless the patient has a relatively long-standing
neurologic impairment or disorder of the lower extremity muscle or joint.<br>
<br>
3. REFLEXES<br>
Loss of, or decrease in, the ankle jerk reflex indicates interruption of the reflex
arc, as may be found in S1 nerve root compromise, such as L5-S1 disk
herniation. For the other nerve root level commonly involved, L5 (the L4-
L5 disk), there is no reflex change except for the posterior tibial tendon reflex,
which is difficult to elicit. When abnormal, the knee jerk reflex indicates an
L4 root problem (L3-L4 disk). This level of involvement is much less common.<br>
<br>
4. SENSORY EXAMINATION<br>
Sensory examination for nerve root compromise in the low back includes
pinprick and light-touch testing. In general, the dorsal foot (especially the
first web space), ankle, and calf areas are correlated with the L5 root, and the
lateral foot is correlated with the S1 root. It is important to keep in mind
the subjective nature of sensory testing and the influence that past exams may
have on a patient with a history of back problems. Light pinprick should not
elicit a painful response. If it does, ask patients if this replicates their typical
low back pain and ask if the pain is superficial or deep. If the pain is typical
of their low back pain or if it is described as deep, this suggests a non-organic
basis for the pain.<br>
<br>
5. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION TESTS<br>
To be successful, the treatment of low back pain generally must be based
upon a correct diagnosis. For a variety of reasons, a patient’s response on any
single test may not be reflective of the presence of identifiable, underlying
pathology. When ambiguity or inconsistency in test results prompts a concern
regarding the correct diagnosis or the appropriate treatment approach, corroborative
testing may be indicated.<br>
A number of tests are commonly employed to distinguish between physiologic
and nonphysiologic responses:<br>
Most common among these are axial loading simulation, fixed pelvic
rotation, exaggerated pain response, distraction simulation testing,
and evaluation for nondermatomal and myotomal symptoms, referred
to collectively as ‘‘Waddell’s signs.’’<br>
The straight-leg-raising test is meant to detect irritation of the lumbar
nerve roots by mechanically pulling on the sciatic nerve, and thus the
root, as it goes around the posterior hip. Straight-leg raising should
be tested in both sitting and lying positions. When sitting, extend and
flex the knee while asking if there is any knee pain. The knee should
then be left fully extended and the patient asked if there is ankle pain
with plantar and dorsiflexion. If a true radicular component is present
the patient should not easily tolerate full extension of the knee with
dorsiflexion of the ankle in the sitting position—the typical response
would be instead for the patient to lean back and complain of radiating
pain. If there is no such response in the sitting position but there is
a positive-lying straight-leg raise, a non-organic basis for the pain is
suggested.<br>
Other tests, such as popliteal (posterior knee) compression, are designed
for the same purpose.<br>
<br>
These tests are subjective and can be confusing if the patient is simply having
generalized pain that is increased by raising the leg. Results of the test are
also influenced by repeated examinations in patients with a recurrent history
of back problems. A negative test is generally a good prognostic sign. A positive
test for lumbar nerve root irritation generally produces pain that radiates
below the knee, and that follows a precise radicular distribution consistent
with the nerve root involved. Crossed-straight-leg raises are the most highly
specific test of sciatic nerve tension.<br>

C. Assessing Red Flags and Indications
for Immediate Referral<br>
Physical-examination evidence of severe neurologic compromise that correlates
with the medical history and test results may indicate a need for immediate
consultation. The examination may further reinforce or reduce suspicions
of tumor, infection, fracture, or dislocation. A history of tumor, infection,
abdominal aneurysm, or other related serious conditions, together with positive
findings on examination, warrants further investigation or referral. A
medical history that suggests pathology originating somewhere other than in
the lumbosacral area may warrant examination of the knee, hip, abdomen,
pelvis or other areas.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diagnostic Criteria<br>
If the patient does not have red flags for serious conditions, the clinician
can then determine which common musculoskeletal disorder is present. The
criteria presented in Table 12-4 follow the clinical thought process, from the
mechanism of illness or injury to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder and, finally, to test results, if any tests are needed to guide treatment
at this stage. The ICD-9 coding system assigns codes based upon pathophysiologic
mechanisms. Specific ICD-9 codes are frequently required for reimbursement
for medical services. However, for at least 90% of low back pain cases,
the ICD-9 codes utilized are overly specific. The pathophysiologic correlates
for lumbar sprain and strain, for example, have not been determined.<br>

<br>
<br>
Work Relatedness<br>
Low back complaints, most of which are multifactorial in origin, can be related
to work in a variety of ways (see Chapter 1). Physical factors that can contribute
to regional low back pain include heavy physical work (especially with rapid
lifting), bending, stretching and reaching, pushing or pulling, and prolonged
sitting or standing. Employment-related factors such as task enjoyment, monotony, job satisfaction, and emotional distress also have been shown to correlate
with the incidence of low back pain. There are no known factors that
correlate with radiculopathy. Heavy lifting in bent or twisted postures, exposure
to vibration, and driving for extended periods have been correlated with
herniated disks, as has smoking. Sciatica has been associated with cumulative
work stress. Age, cardiovascular fitness, obesity, and non-work stress are other
factors that have been correlated with low back pain. Many cases are idiopathic,
as the mechanism of regional back pain has not yet been elucidated. It also
should be noted that the existence of a correlation between various factors
and low back pain does NOT indicate that a causal relationship has actually
been demonstrated, as association is not equivalent to causation. Very specific
description of work-duty repetitions, and the length of time they take to
performwould be needed to ascertain the probable relationship between work
and these conditions.<br>
There is no evidence for the effectiveness of lumbar supports in preventing
back pain in industry. Proper lifting techniques and discussion of general
conditioning should be emphasized, although teaching proper lifting mechanics
and even eliminating strenuous lifting fails to prevent back injury claims
and back discomfort, according to some high-quality studies.<br>
Recurrence of regional low back pain is not uncommon, regardless of
whether or not the pain is work related. In fact, a prior history of low back
pain or sciatica is a powerful predictor of a future episode. It is not clear,
however, whether a recurrence of the complaint represents a recurrence of a
quantifiable physical injury, because pain is a subjective experience, and the
anatomic pathology of regional low back pain has not been well documented.
If an underlying condition is aggravated at work, it is important to document
the course of pain and activity limitation due to the aggravating factors.
Restoration to the prior activity level is the goal. When that level has been
reached, the effects of the aggravation can be said to have ceased. At that
point, cure and relief have been accomplished.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Care<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s first concern. Nonprescription analgesics will
provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute symptoms.
If treatment response is inadequate (i.e., if symptoms and activity limitations
continue), prescribed pharmaceuticals or physical methods can be added.
Comorbid conditions, side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences
guide the clinician’s choice of recommendations. Table 12-5 summarizes comfort
options.<br>
<br>
Physical Methods<br>
<br>
Manipulation appears safe and effective in the first few weeks of back
pain without radiculopathy. Of note is that most studies of manipulation
have compared it with interventions other than therapeutic exercise, hence its value as compared with active, rather than passive,
therapeutic options is unclear. Nonetheless, in the acute phases of
injury manipulation may enhance patient mobilization. If manipulation
does not bring improvement in three to four weeks, it should be
stopped and the patient reevaluated. For patients with symptoms lasting
longer than one month, manipulation is probably safe but efficacy
has not been proved.<br>
<br>
A trial of manipulation for patients with radiculopathy may also be an
option. There is consensus on its utility among practitioners who
perform it, when radiculopathy is not progressive, and large series
and cohort studies suggest value for some forms of manipulation.
Randomized trials are under way. As with any promising intervention
in the absence of definitive high-quality evidence, careful attention to
patient response to treatment is critical. Many passive and palliative
interventions can provide relief in the short termbut may risk treatment
dependence without meaningful long-termbenefit. Such interventions
may be used to the extent they are aimed at facilitating return to
normal functional activities, particularly work.<br>
<br>
Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) cannot be recommended at
the present time because high quality studies do not exist and the
procedure has significant associated risks.<br>
<br>
Traction has not been proved effective for lasting relief in treating low
back pain. Because evidence is insufficient to support using vertebral
axial decompression for treating low back injuries, it is not recommended.<br>
<br>
Physical modalities such as massage, diathermy, cutaneous laser treatment,
ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS)
units, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) units, and
biofeedback have no proven efficacy in treating acute low back symptoms.
Insufficient scientific testing exists to determine the effectiveness
of these therapies, but they may have some value in the short term if
used in conjunction with a program of functional restoration. Insufficient
evidence exists to determine the effectiveness of sympathetic
therapy, a noninvasive treatment involving electrical stimulation, also
known as interferential therapy. At-home local applications of heat or
cold are as effective as those performed by therapists.<br>
<br>
Acupuncture has not been found effective in the management of back
pain, based on several high-quality studies, but there is anecdotal
evidence of its success.<br>
<br>
Invasive techniques (e.g., local injections and facet-joint injections of
cortisone and lidocaine) are of questionable merit. Although epidural
steroid injections may afford short-term improvement in leg pain and
sensory deficits in patients with nerve root compression due to a
herniated nucleus pulposus, this treatment offers no significant longtermfunctional
benefit, nor does it reduce the need for surgery. Despite
the fact that proof is still lacking, many pain physicians believe that
diagnostic and/or therapeutic injections may have benefit in patients
presenting in the transitional phase between acute and chronic pain.<br>
<br>
There are conflicting studies concerning the effectiveness of prolotherapy,
also known as sclerotherapy, in the low back. Lasting functional
improvement has not been shown. The injections are invasive, may
be painful to the patient, and are not generally accepted or widely used.
Therefore, using prolotherapy for low back pain is not recommended.<br>
<br>
There is good quality medical literature demonstrating that radiofrequency
neurotomy of facet joint nerves in the cervical spine provides
good temporary relief of pain. Similar quality literature does not exist
regarding the same procedure in the lumbar region. Lumbar facet
neurotomies reportedly produce mixed results. Facet neurotomies
should be performed only after appropriate investigation involving
controlled differential dorsal ramus medial branch diagnostic blocks.<br>
<br>
Other miscellaneous therapies, such as magnet therapy, have been
evaluated and found to be ineffective or minimally effective.<br>
<br>
Some studies support neuroreflexotherapy (the temporary implantation
of epidermal devices in trigger points in the back and referred
tender points in the ear), but the procedure is invasive, and some
questions exist regarding its potential benefit versus risk and cost.<br>
<br>
Lumbar supports have not been shown to have any lasting benefit
beyond the acute phase of symptom relief.<br>
<br>
Moderate evidence suggests that back schools have better short-term
effects than other treatments for chronic low back pain, and that such
schools are more effective in an occupational setting than in a nonoccupational
setting. No good evidence supports using back schools
for prevention, as opposed to treatment.<br>
<br>
Behavioral therapy may be an effective treatment for patients with
chronic low back pain, but it is still unknown what type of patient
benefits most from what type of behavioral treatment. Some studies
provide evidence that intensive multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation
with a functional restoration approach improves pain and
function.<br>
<br>

<br>
Table 12-5. Methods of Symptom Control for Low Back Complaints<br>
RECOMMENDED<br>
Nonprescription Medications: Acetaminophen (safest), NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)<br>
Physical Therapeutic Interventions: Adjustment or modification of workstation, job tasks, or work hours and methods, Stretching, Specific low back exercises for range of motion and strengthening, At-home local applications of cold in first few days of acute complaint; thereafter, applications of heat or cold, Relaxation techniques, Aerobic exercise, 1-2 visits for education, counseling, and evaluation of home exercise for range of motion and strengthening<br>
Prescribed Pharmaceutical Methods: Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Short-term muscle relaxants for acute spasms, Short-term opiates are rarely recommended, but may be used if symptoms are severe and accompanied by objective findings, for no more than two weeks<br>
OPTIONS<br>
Lumbar Disk Protrusion with Radiculopathy: 2 days bed rest if symptoms are severe<br>
Lumbar Strain: 1-2 days rest if symptoms are severe<br>
Sciatica: 1-2 days rest if symptoms are severe<br>
Spinal Stenosis: Instruction in body mechanics<br> 
Postlaminectomy Syndrome: 2 days rest if symptoms are severe<br>
Regional Low Back Symptoms: 1-2 days rest if symptoms are severe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Activity Alteration<br>
Bed rest has been used as a treatment for acute low back pain; however,
debilitation and irritation can result from prolonged bed rest. The most severe
cases of low back pain can be treated with one to two days of bed rest, but
bed rest is not advisable as routine treatment.<br>
Activities causing an increase in low back symptoms should be reviewed
with the patient and modifications advised. Driving, workstation positions,
repetitive motions, and other activities (that may or may not be obvious to
the patient) may require modification.<br>
While the patient is recovering from low back symptoms, activities that
do not aggravate symptoms can be maintained, and exercises to prevent debilitation
due to inactivity can be advised. The patient should be informed that
this may temporarily increase symptoms. Work activity modification is an
important part of any treatment regimen. Advice on how to avoid aggravating
activities includes a review of work duties to decide whether or not modifications
can be accomplished without employer notification and to determine
whether modified duty is available. Making every attempt to maintain the
patient at maximal levels of activity, including work activities, is recommended.
Aerobic exercise is beneficial as a conservative management technique, and
exercising as little as 20 minutes twice a week can be effective in managing
low back pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Activities<br>
Table 12-6 provides recommendations on activity modification and duration
of absence from work. These guidelines are intended for patients without
comorbidity or complicating factors, including employment or legal issues.
They are targets to provide a guide from the perspective of physiologic recovery.
The clinician can make it clear to patients and employers that:<br>
Even moderately heavy lifting, carrying, or working in awkward positions
may aggravate back symptoms from low back strain or lumbosacral
nerve root irritation, for example; and<br>
Any restrictions are intended to allow for spontaneous recovery or for
time to build activity tolerance through exercise.<br>
<br>
Measures to assist the patient in avoiding aggravating activities include a review
of work duties to decide whether modifications can be made without employer
notification and to determine whether modified duty is available. Make every
attempt to maintain the patient at maximal levels of activity, including work
activities.<br>

<br>
Follow-up Visits<br>
Patients with potentially work-related low back complaints should have followup
every three to five days by a midlevel practitioner or physical therapist who
can counsel the patient about avoiding static positions, medication use, activity
modification, and other concerns. Health practitioners should take care to
answer questions and make these sessions interactive so that the patient is
fully involved in his or her recovery. If the patient has returned to work, these
interactions may be conducted on site or by telephone to avoid interfering
with modified- or full-work activities.<br>
Physician follow-up can occur when a release to modified-, increased-, or
full-duty is needed, or after appreciable healing or recovery can be expected,
on average. Physician follow-up might be expected every four to seven days
if the patient is off work and seven to fourteen days if the patient is working.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
Lumbar spine x rays should not be recommended in patients with low back
pain in the absence of red flags for serious spinal pathology, even if the pain
has persisted for at least six weeks. However, it may be appropriate when the
physician believes it would aid in patient management.<br>
Unequivocal objective findings that identify specific nerve compromise
on the neurologic examination are sufficient evidence to warrant imaging in
patients who do not respond to treatment and who would consider surgery
an option. When the neurologic examination is less clear, however, further
physiologic evidence of nerve dysfunction should be obtained before ordering
an imaging study. Indiscriminant imaging will result in false-positive findings,
such as disk bulges, that are not the source of painful symptoms and do
not warrant surgery. If physiologic evidence indicates tissue insult or nerve
impairment, the practitioner can discuss with a consultant the selection of an
imaging test to define a potential cause (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] for
neural or other soft tissue, computer tomography [CT] for bony structures).<br>
Electromyography (EMG), including H-reflex tests, may be useful to
identify subtle, focal neurologic dysfunction in patients with low back symptoms
lasting more than three or four weeks. Diskography is not recommended
for assessing patients with acute low back symptoms.<br>
Table 12-7 provides a general comparison of the abilities of different
techniques to identify physiologic insult and define anatomic defects. An
imaging study may be appropriate for a patient whose limitations due to
consistent symptoms have persisted for one month or more to further evaluate
the possibility of potentially serious pathology, such as a tumor.<br>
Relying solely on imaging studies to evaluate the source of low back
and related symptoms carries a significant risk of diagnostic confusion (falsepositive
test results) because of the possibility of identifying a finding that was
present before symptoms began and therefore has no temporal association
with the symptoms. Techniques vary in their abilities to define abnormalities
(Table 12-7). Imaging studies should be reserved for cases in which surgery
is considered or red-flag diagnoses are being evaluated. Because the overall
false-positive rate is 30% for imaging studies in patients over age 30 who do
not have symptoms, the risk of diagnostic confusion is great.<br>
Magnetic resonance (MR) neurography may be useful in isolating diagnoses
that do not lend themselves to back surgery, such as sciatica caused by
piriformis syndrome in the hip. However, MR neurography is still new and
needs to be validated by quality studies.<br>
Recent studies on diskography do not support its use as a preoperative
indication for either intradiskal electrothermal (IDET) annuloplasty or fusion.
Diskography does not identify the symptomatic high-intensity zone, and concordance
of symptoms with the disk injected is of limited diagnostic value
(common in non-back issue patients, inaccurate if chronic or abnormal psychosocial tests), and it can produce significant symptoms in controls more
than a year later. Tears may not correlate anatomically or temporally with
symptoms. Diskography may be used where fusion is a realistic consideration,
and it may provide supplemental information prior to surgery. This area is
rapidly evolving, and clinicians should consult the latest available studies.
Despite the lack of strong medical evidence supporting it, diskography is fairly
common, and when considered, it should be reserved only for patients who
meet the following criteria:<br>
Back pain of at least three months duration.<br>
Failure of conservative treatment.<br>
Satisfactory results from detailed psychosocial assessment. (Diskography
in subjects with emotional and chronic pain problems has been
linked to reports of significant back pain for prolonged periods after
injection, and therefore should be avoided.)<br>
Is a candidate for surgery.<br>

surgery.<br>

Surgical Considerations<br>
Within the first three months after onset of acute low back symptoms, surgery
is considered only when serious spinal pathology or nerve root dysfunction
not responsive to conservative therapy (and obviously due to a herniated disk)
is detected. Disk herniation, characterized by protrusion of the central nucleus
pulposus through a defect in the outer annulus fibrosis, may impinge on a
nerve root, causing irritation, back and leg symptoms, and nerve root dysfunction.
The presence of a herniated disk on an imaging study, however, does
not necessarily imply nerve root dysfunction. Studies of asymptomatic adults
commonly demonstrate intervertebral disk herniations that apparently do not
cause symptoms. Some studies show spontaneous disk resorption without
surgery, while others suggest that pain may be due to irritation of the dorsal
root ganglion by inflammogens (metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, interleukin-
6, prostaglandin E2) released from a damaged disk in the absence of anatomical
evidence of direct contact between neural elements and disk material. Therefore,
referral for surgical consultation is indicated for patients who have:<br>
Severe and disabling lower leg symptoms in a distribution consistent
with abnormalities on imaging studies (radiculopathy), preferably with
accompanying objective signs of neural compromise<br>
Activity limitations due to radiating leg pain for more than one month
or extreme progression of lower leg symptoms<br>
Clear clinical, imaging, and electrophysiologic evidence of a lesion
that has been shown to benefit in both the short and long term from
surgical repair<br>
Failure of conservative treatment to resolve disabling radicular symptoms<br>
<br>
If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks and
benefits, and, especially, expectations is very important. Patients with acute
low back pain alone, without findings of serious conditions or significant nerve
root compromise, rarely benefit from either surgical consultation or surgery.
If there is no clear indication for surgery, referring the patient to a physical
medicine practitioner may help resolve the symptoms.<br>
Before referral for surgery, clinicians should consider referral for psychological
screening to improve surgical outcomes, possibly including standard tests
such as the second edition of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(MMPI-2). In addition, clinicians may look for Waddell signs during the
physical exam.<br>
Many patients with strong clinical findings of nerve root dysfunction due
to disk herniation recover activity tolerance within one month; there is no
evidence that delaying surgery for this period worsens outcomes in the absence
of progressive nerve root compromise. With or without surgery, more than
80% of patients with apparent surgical indications eventually recover. Although
surgery appears to speed short- to mid-term recovery, surgical morbidity
(recovery and rehabilitation time and effects) and complications must be
considered. Surgery benefits fewer than 40% of patients with questionable
physiologic findings. Moreover, surgery increases the need for future surgical
procedures with higher complication rates. In good surgery centers, the overall
incidence of complications from first-time disk surgery is less than 1%. However,
for older patients and repeat procedures, the rate of complications is
dramatically higher. Patients with comorbid conditions, such as cardiac or
respiratory disease, diabetes, or mental illness, may be poor candidates for
surgery. Comorbidity should be weighed and discussed carefully with the
patient. Following surgery, exercise is much better than manipulation for
rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
A. Lumbosacral Nerve Root Decompression<br>
Direct methods of nerve root decompression include laminotomy, standard
diskectomy, and laminectomy. Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain is an example
of an indirect method. Indirect chemical methods are less efficacious
and have rare but serious complications (e.g., anaphylaxis, arachnoiditis). Percutaneous
diskectomy is not recommended because proof of its effectiveness
has not been demonstrated. Recent studies of chemonucleolysis have shown
it to be more effective than placebo, and it is less invasive, but less effective, than
surgical diskectomy; however, few providers are experienced in this procedure
because it is not widely used anymore. Surgical diskectomy for carefully selected
patients with nerve root compression due to lumbar disk prolapse provides
faster relief from the acute attack than conservative management; but any
positive or negative effects on the lifetime natural history of the underlying
disk disease are still unclear. Given the extremely low level of evidence available
for artificial disk replacement or percutaneous endoscopic laser diskectomy
(PELD), it is recommended that these procedures be regarded as experimental
at this time.<br>
<br>
B. Intradiskal Electrothermal Annuloplasty<br>
Intradiskal electrothermal annuloplasty may show some advantages over diskectomy,
but IDET is operator dependent and not considered ready for wholesale
use by the public. Early outcomes may exaggerate the efficacy of IDET
because some who initially improve later deteriorate. In addition, studies of
IDET have relied on diskography, a technique not well supported by the
medical evidence.<br>
<br>
C. Implantable Spinal Cord Stimulators<br>
Implantable spinal cord stimulators are rarely used and should be reserved
for patients with low back pain for more than six months duration who have
not responded to the standard nonoperative or operative interventions.<br>
<br>
D. Management of Spinal Stenosis<br>
Spinal stenosis usually results from soft tissue and bony encroachment of the
spinal canal and nerve roots. It has a gradual onset and usually manifests as
a degenerative process after age 50. Evidence does not currently support a
relationship with work. The surgical treatment for spinal stenosis is usually
complete laminectomy. Elderly patients with spinal stenosis who tolerate their
daily activities usually do not require surgery unless bowel or bladder dysfunction
develops. Surgery is rarely considered in the first three months after onset
of symptoms, and a decision to proceed with surgery should not be based
solely on the results of imaging studies. Some evidence suggests that patients
with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit more from surgery than from
conservative treatment.<br>
<br>
E. Spinal Fusion<br>
Except for cases of trauma-related spinal fracture or dislocation, fusion of the
spine is not usually considered during the first three months of symptoms.
Patients with increased spinal instability (not work-related) after surgical decompression
at the level of degenerative spondylolisthesis may be candidates
for fusion. There is no scientific evidence about the long-term effectiveness
of any form of surgical decompression or fusion for degenerative lumbar
spondylosis compared with natural history, placebo, or conservative treatment.
There is no good evidence from controlled trials that spinal fusion alone is
effective for treating any type of acute low back problem, in the absence of
spinal fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis if there is instability and motion
in the segment operated on. It is important to note that although it is being
undertaken, lumbar fusion in patients with other types of low back pain very
seldom cures the patient. A recent study has shown that only 29% assessed
themselves as ‘‘much better’’ in the surgical group versus 14% ‘‘much better’’
in the nonfusion group (a 15% greater chance of being ‘‘much better’’) versus
a 17% complication rate (including 9% life-threatening or reoperation).<br>
