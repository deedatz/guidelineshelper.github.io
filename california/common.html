            (a) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:<br>
            (1) "Acupuncture" is used as an option when pain medication is reduced or not tolerated, it may be used as an adjunct to physical rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention to hasten functional recovery. It is the insertion and removal of filiform needles to stimulate acupoints (acupuncture points). Needles may be inserted, manipulated, and retained for a period of time. Acupuncture can be used to reduce pain, reduce inflammation, increase blood flow, increase range of motion, decrease the side effect of medication-induced nausea, promote relaxation in an anxious patient, and reduce muscle spasm.<br>
            (2) "Acupuncture with electrical stimulation" is the use of electrical current (micro-amperage or milli-amperage) on the needles at the acupuncture site. It is used to increase effectiveness of the needles by continuous stimulation of the acupoint. Physiological effects (depending on location and settings) can include endorphin release for pain relief, reduction of inflammation, increased blood circulation, analgesia through interruption of pain stimulus, and muscle relaxation. It is indicated to treat chronic pain conditions, radiating pain along a nerve pathway, muscle spasm, inflammation, scar tissue pain, and pain located in multiple sites.<br>
          	(3) "Chronic pain for purposes of acupuncture" means chronic pain as defined in section 9792.20(c).<br>  
            (b) Application<br>
            (1) These guidelines apply to acupuncture or acupuncture with electrical stimulation when referenced in the clinical topic medical treatment guidelines in the series of sections commencing with 9792.23.1 et seq., or in the chronic pain medical treatment guidelines contained in section 9792.24.2.<br>
			(c) Frequency and duration of acupuncture or acupuncture with electrical stimulation may be performed as follows:<br>
            (1) Time to produce functional improvement: 3 to 6 treatments.<br>
            (2) Frequency: 1 to 3 times per week<br>
            (3) Optimum duration: 1 to 2 months<br>
            (d) Acupuncture treatments may be extended if functional improvement is documented as defined in Section 9792.20(f).<br>
			(e) It is beyond the scope of the Acupuncture Medical Treatment Guidelines to state the precautions, limitations, contraindications or adverse events resulting from acupuncture or acupuncture with electrical stimulations. These decisions are left up to the acupuncturist.<br>

		<td>California Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule<br>
			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Amitriptyline<br>
			Recommended. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. See Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Tricyclics listing for more information and references.<br> 
			Antidepressants for chronic pain<br>
			Recommended as a first line option for neuropathic pain, and as a possibility for non-neuropathic pain. (Feuerstein, 1997) (Perrot, 2006) Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. Analgesia generally occurs within a few days to a week, whereas antidepressant effect takes longer to occur. (Saarto-Cochrane, 2005) Assessment of treatment efficacy should include not only pain outcomes, but also an evaluation of function, changes in use of other analgesic medication, sleep quality and duration, and psychological assessment. Side effects, including excessive sedation (especially that which would affect work performance) should be assessed. (Additional side effects are listed below for each specific drug.) It is recommended that these outcome measurements should be initiated at one week of treatment with a recommended trial of at least 4 weeks. The optimal duration of treatment is not known because most double-blind trials have been of short duration (6-12 weeks). It has been suggested that if pain is in remission for 3-6 months, a gradual tapering of anti-depressants may be undertaken. (Perrot, 2006) (Schnitzer, 2004) (Lin-JAMA, 2003) (Salerno, 2002) (Moulin, 2001) (Fishbain, 2000) (Taylor, 2004) (Gijsman, 2004) (Jick-JAMA, 2004) (Barbui, 2004) (Asnis, 2004) (Stein, 2003) (Pollack, 2003) (Ticknor, 2004) (Staiger, 2003) Long-term effectiveness of anti-depressants has not been established. (Wong, 2007) The effect of this class of medication in combination with other classes of drugs has not been well researched. (Finnerup, 2005) The "number needed to treat" (NNT) methodology (calculated as the reciprocal value of the response rate on active and placebo) has been used to calculate efficacy of the different classes of antidepressants. (Sindrup, 2005)<br>
			SPECIFIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS:<br>
			Tricyclic antidepressants are recommended over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), unless adverse reactions are a problem. Caution is required because tricyclics have a low threshold for toxicity, and tricyclic antidepressant overdose is a significant cause of fatal drug poisoning due to their cardiovascular and neurological effects. Tricyclic antidepressants have been shown in both a meta-analysis (McQuay, 1996) and a systematic review (Collins, 2000) to be effective, and are considered a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. (Namaka, 2004) (Dworkin, 2003) (Gilron, 2006) (Wolfe, 2004) (Dworkin, 2007) (Saarto-Cochrane, 2007) This class of medications works in both patients with normal mood and patients with depressed mood when used in treatment for neuropathic pain. (Sindrup, 2005) Indications in controlled trials have shown effectiveness in treating central post-stroke pain, post-herpetic neuralgia (Argoff, 2004), painful diabetic and non-diabetic polyneuropathy, and post-mastectomy pain. Negative results were found for spinal cord pain and phantom-limb pain, but this may have been due to study design. (Finnerup, 2005) Tricyclics have not demonstrated significance in randomized-control trials in treating HIV neuropathy, spinal cord injury, cisplatinum neuropathy, neuropathic cancer pain, phantom limb pain or chronic lumbar root pain. (Dworkin, 2007) One review reported the NNT for at least moderate neuropathic pain relief with tricyclics is 3.6 (3-4.5), with the NNT for amitriptyline being 3.1 (2.5-4.2). The NNT for venlafaxine, calculated using 3 studies, was reported to be 3.1 (2.2-5.1). (Saarto-Cochrane, 2007) Another review reported that the NNT for 50% improvement in neuropathic pain was 2 to 3 for tricyclic antidepressants, 4 for venlafaxine, and 7 for SSRIs (Perrot, 2008).<br>
			Side-effect profile: Tricyclics are contraindicated in patients with cardiac conduction disturbances and/or decompensation (they can produce heart block and arrhythmias) as well as for those patients with epilepsy. For patients > 40 years old, a screening ECG is recommended prior to initiation of therapy. (Dworkin, 2007) (ICSI, 2007) They can create anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth, sweating, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, constipation, and urinary retention. (Finnerup, 2005) To minimize side effects, it is suggested that titration should be slow and based on the patient's response. (Namaka, 2004) An alternative choice may be a SNRI. (Finnerup, 2005) (Sindrup, 2005) (Dworkin, 2007)<br>
			Dosing Information:<br>
			Amitriptyline: Neuropathic pain: The starting dose may be as low as 10-25 mg at night, with increases of 10-25 mg once or twice a week up to 100 mg/day. (ICSI, 2007) The lowest effective dose should be used (Dworkin, 2007). Fibromyalgia: One review recommended the following dosing regimen: Start with low doses, such as 5-10 mg 1-3 hours before bedtime. Dose may be increased by 5 mg at two-week intervals; final dose is dependent upon efficacy and patient tolerability to side effects. Doses that have been studied range from 25 to 50 mg at bedtime.

		<td>California Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule<br>
			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Bupropion (Wellbutrin)<br>
			Recommended as an option after other agents. While bupropion has shown some efficacy in neuropathic pain there is no evidence of efficacy in patients with non-neuropathic chronic low back pain. Furthermore, bupropion is generally a third-line medication for diabetic neuropathy and may be considered when patients have not had a response to a tricyclic or SNRI. See Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Bupropion listing for more information and references.<br>
			Antidepressants for chronic pain<br>
			Recommended as a first line option for neuropathic pain, and as a possibility for non-neuropathic pain. (Feuerstein, 1997) (Perrot, 2006) Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. Analgesia generally occurs within a few days to a week, whereas antidepressant effect takes longer to occur. (Saarto-Cochrane, 2005)<br>
			SPECIFIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS:<br>
			Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):<br>
			Bupropion (Wellbutrin), a second-generation non-tricyclic antidepressant (a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor) has been shown to be effective in relieving neuropathic pain of different etiologies in a small trial (41 patients). (Finnerup, 2005) While bupropion has shown some efficacy in neuropathic pain there is no evidence of efficacy in patients with non-neuropathic chronic low back pain. (Katz, 2005) Furthermore, a recent review suggested that bupropion is generally a third-line medication for diabetic neuropathy and may be considered when patients have not had a response to a tricyclic or SNRI. (Dworkin, 2007)<br>
			Side-effect profile: Headache, agitation, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss<br>
			Dosing Information: Neuropathic pain (off-label indication): 100 mg once daily, increase by 100 mg per week up to 200 mg twice daily. (Maizels, 2005)<br>
			Dosing: Neuropathic pain (off-label indication): 37.5 mg once daily, increase by 37.5 mg per week up to 300 mg daily. (Maizels, 2005) (ICSI, 2007) Trial period: Some relief may occur in first two weeks; full benefit may not occur until six weeks. Withdrawal effects can be severe. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided and tapering is recommended before discontinuation.<br>

		<td>California Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule<br>
			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Carisoprodol (Soma)<br>
			Not recommended. This medication is not indicated for long-term use. Carisoprodol is a commonly prescribed, centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant whose primary active metabolite is meprobamate (a schedule-IV controlled substance). Carisoprodol is now scheduled in several states but not on a federal level. It has been suggested that the main effect is due to generalized sedation and treatment of anxiety. Abuse has been noted for sedative and relaxant effects. In regular abusers the main concern is the accumulation of meprobamate. Carisoprodol abuse has also been noted in order to augment or alter effects of other drugs. This includes the following: (1) increasing sedation of benzodiazepines or alcohol; (2) use to prevent side effects of cocaine; (3) use with tramadol to produce relaxation and euphoria; (4) as a combination with hydrocodone, an effect that some abusers claim is similar to heroin (referred to as a "Las Vegas Cocktail"); & (5) as a combination with codeine (referred to as "Soma Coma"). (Reeves, 1999) (Reeves, 2001) (Reeves, 2008) (Schears, 2004) There was a 300% increase in numbers of emergency room episodes related to carisoprodol from 1994 to 2005. (DHSS, 2005) Intoxication appears to include subdued consciousness, decreased cognitive function, and abnormalities of the eyes, vestibular function, appearance, gait and motor function. Intoxication includes the effects of both carisoprodol and meprobamate, both of which act on different neurotransmitters. (Bramness, 2007) (Bramness, 2004) A withdrawal syndrome has been documented that consists of insomnia, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, anxiety, and ataxia when abrupt discontinuation of large doses occurs. This is similar to withdrawal from meprobamate. (Reeves, 2007) (Reeves, 2004) There is little research in terms of weaning of high dose carisoprodol and there is no standard treatment regimen for patients with known dependence. Most treatment includes treatment for symptomatic complaints of withdrawal. Another option is to switch to phenobarbital to prevent withdrawal with subsequent tapering. A maximum dose of phenobarbital is 500 mg/day and the taper is 30 mg/day with a slower taper in an outpatient setting. Tapering should be individualized for each patient. (Boothby, 2003) For more information and references, see Muscle relaxants. See also Weaning of medications.<br>
			Muscle relaxants (for pain)<br>
			ANTISPASMODICS: Used to decrease muscle spasm in conditions such as LBP although it appears that these medications are often used for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions whether spasm is present or not. The mechanism of action for most of these agents is not known. (Chou, 2004)<br>
			Carisoprodol (Soma, Soprodal 350, Vanadom, generic available): Neither of these formulations is recommended for longer than a 2 to 3 week period. Carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate an anixolytic that is a schedule IV controlled substance. Carisoprodol is classified as a schedule IV drug in several states but not on a federal level. It is suggested that its main effect is due to generalized sedation as well as treatment of anxiety. This drug was approved for marketing before the FDA required clinical studies to prove safety and efficacy. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with abrupt discontinuation. (See, 2008) (Reeves, 2003) For more details, see Carisoprodol, where it is "Not recommended." See also Weaning of medications.<br>
			Side Effects: drowsiness, psychological and physical dependence, & withdrawal with acute discontinuation.
			Dosing: 250 mg-350 mg four times a day. (See, 2008)<br>

			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Opioids, specific drug list<br>
			Codeine (Tylenol with Codeine; generic available): Codeine as a single active ingredient is classified by the DEA as a schedule II medication. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen is classified as schedule III. Side Effects: Common effects include CNS depression and hypotension. Drowsiness and constipation occur in > 10% of cases. Codeine should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse. Tolerance, as well as psychological and physical dependence may occur. Abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use may result in withdrawal. (AHFS Drug Information, 2008) (Clinical Pharmacology, 2008) (Lexi&ndash;Comp, 2008). Analgesic dose: codeine &ndash; 15mg to 60mg per dose (Max 360mg/24hr), and acetaminophen 300mg to 1000mg per dose (Max 400mg/24hr). Doses may be given as needed up to every 4 hours. (Product information, Ortho&ndash;McNeil)<br>
			Opioids, criteria for use<br>
			CRITERIA FOR USE OF OPIOIDS<br>
			4) On&ndash;Going Management. Actions Should Include:<br>
			(a) Prescriptions from a single practitioner taken as directed, and all prescriptions from a single pharmacy.<br>
			(b) The lowest possible dose should be prescribed to improve pain and function.<br>
			(c) Office: Ongoing review and documentation of pain relief, functional status, appropriate medication use, and side effects. Pain assessment should include: current pain; the least reported pain over the period since last assessment; average pain; intensity of pain after taking the opioid; how long it takes for pain relief; and how long pain relief lasts. Satisfactory response to treatment may be indicated by the patient's decreased pain, increased level of function, or improved quality of life. Information from family members or other caregivers should be considered in determining the patient's response to treatment. The 4 A's for Ongoing Monitoring: Four domains have been proposed as most relevant for ongoing monitoring of chronic pain patients on opioids: pain relief, side effects, physical and psychosocial functioning, and the occurrence of any potentially aberrant (or nonadherent) drug&ndash;related behaviors. These domains have been summarized as the &quot;4 A's&quot; (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, and aberrant drug&ndash;taking behaviors). The monitoring of these outcomes over time should affect therapeutic decisions and provide a framework for documentation of the clinical use of these controlled drugs. (Passik, 2000)<br>
			(d) Home: To aid in pain and functioning assessment, the patient should be requested to keep a pain dairy that includes entries such as pain triggers, and incidence of end&ndash;of&ndash;dose pain. It should be emphasized that using this diary will help in tailoring the opioid dose. This should not be a requirement for pain management.
			(e) Use of drug screening or inpatient treatment with issues of abuse, addiction, or poor pain control.<br>
			(f) Documentation of misuse of medications (doctor&ndash;shopping, uncontrolled drug escalation, drug diversion).<br>
			(g) Continuing review of overall situation with regard to nonopioid means of pain control.<br>
			(h) Consideration of a consultation with a multidisciplinary pain clinic if doses of opioids are required beyond what is usually required for the condition or pain does not improve on opioids in 3 months. Consider a psych consult if there is evidence of depression, anxiety or irritability. Consider an addiction medicine consult if there is evidence of substance misuse.<br>
			6) When to Discontinue Opioids: See Opioid hyperalgesia. Also see Weaning of Medications. Prior to discontinuing, it should be determined that the patient has not had treatment failure due to causes that can be corrected such as under&ndash;dosing or inappropriate dosing schedule. Weaning should occur under direct ongoing medical supervision as a slow taper except for the below mentioned possible indications for immediate discontinuation. The patient should not be abandoned.<br>
			(a) If there is no overall improvement in function, unless there are extenuating circumstances<br>
			(b) Continuing pain with the evidence of intolerable adverse effects<br>
			(c) Decrease in functioning<br>
			(d) Resolution of pain<br>
			(e) If serious non&ndash;adherence is occurring<br>
			(f) The patient requests discontinuing<br>
			(g) Immediate discontinuation has been suggested for: evidence of illegal activity including diversion, prescription forgery, or stealing; the patient is involved in a motor vehicle accident and/or arrest related to opioids, illicit drugs and/or alcohol; intentional suicide attempt; aggressive or threatening behavior in the clinic. It is suggested that a patient be given a 30&ndash;day supply of medications (to facilitate finding other treatment) or be started on a slow weaning schedule if a decision is made by the physician to terminate prescribing of opioids/controlled substances.<br>
			(h) Many physicians will allow one &quot;slip&quot; from a medication contract without immediate termination of opioids/controlled substances, with the consequences being a re&ndash;discussion of the clinic policy on controlled substances, including the consequences of repeat violations.<br>
			(i) If there are repeated violations from the medication contract or any other evidence of abuse, addiction, or possible diversion it has been suggested that a patient show evidence of a consult with a physician that is trained in addiction to assess the ongoing situation and recommend possible detoxification. (Weaver, 2002)<br>
			(j) When the patient is requesting opioid medications for their pain and inconsistencies are identified in the history, presentation, behaviors or physical findings, physicians and surgeons who make a clinical decision to withhold opioid medications should document the basis for their decision.<br>
			7) When to Continue Opioids<br>
			(a) If the patient has returned to work<br>
			(b) If the patient has improved functioning and pain (Washington, 2002) (Colorado, 2002) (Ontario, 2000) (VA/DoD, 2003) (Maddox&ndash;AAPM/APS, 1997) (Wisconsin, 2004) (Warfield, 2004)<br>
			Opioids, dosing<br>
			Recommend that dosing not exceed 120 mg oral morphine equivalents per day, and for patients taking more than one opioid, the morphine equivalent doses of the different opioids must be added together to determine the cumulative dose.<br>
			Opioid Dosing Calculator Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) factor:<br>
			Codeine &ndash; 0.15<br>
			Fentanyl transdermal (in mcg/hr) &ndash; 2.4<br>

			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)<br>
			Recommended as an option, using a short course of therapy. See Medications for chronic pain for other preferred options. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain; the effect is modest and comes at the price of greater adverse effects. The effect is greatest in the first 4 days of treatment, suggesting that shorter courses may be better. (Browning, 2001) Treatment should be brief. There is also a post-op use. The addition of cyclobenzaprine to other agents is not recommended. (Clinical Pharmacology, 2008) Cyclobenzaprine-treated patients with fibromyalgia were 3 times as likely to report overall improvement and to report moderate reductions in individual symptoms, particularly sleep. (Tofferi, 2004) Note: Cyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline. See Antidepressants. Cyclobenzaprine is associated with a number needed to treat of 3 at 2 weeks for symptom improvement in LBP and is associated with drowsiness and dizziness. (Kinkade, 2007) Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant and a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that is marketed as Flexeril by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical.<br>

			ANTISPASMODICS: Used to decrease muscle spasm in conditions such as LBP although it appears that these medications are often used for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions whether spasm is present or not. The mechanism of action for most of these agents is not known. (Chou, 2004)<br> 
			Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril, Amrix, Fexmid, generic available): Recommended for a short course of therapy. Limited, mixed-evidence does not allow for a recommendation for chronic use. Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant and a central nervous system depressant with similar effects to tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline). Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain, although the effect is modest and comes at the price of adverse effects. It has a central mechanism of action, but it is not effective in treating spasticity from cerebral palsy or spinal cord disease. Cyclobenzaprine is associated with a number needed to treat of 3 at 2 weeks for symptom improvement. The greatest effect appears to be in the first 4 days of treatment. (Browning, 2001) (Kinkade, 2007) (Toth, 2004) See Cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine has been shown to produce a modest benefit in treatment of fibromyalgia. Cyclobenzaprine-treated patients with fibromyalgia were 3 times more likely to report overall improvement and to report moderate reductions in individual symptoms (particularly sleep). A meta-analysis concluded that the number needed to treat for patients with fibromyalgia was 4.8. (ICSI, 2007) (Tofferi, 2004)<br>
			Side Effects: Include anticholinergic effects (drowsiness, urinary retention and dry mouth). Sedative effects may limit use. Headache has been noted. This medication should be avoided in patients with arrhythmias, heart block, heart failure and recent myocardial infarction. Side effects limit use in the elderly. (See, 2008) (Toth, 2004)<br>
			Dosing: 5 mg three times a day. Can be increased to 10 mg three times a day. This medication is not recommended to be used for longer than 2-3 weeks. (See, 2008)<br>

			Duloxetine (Cymbalta)<br>
			Recommended as an option in first-line treatment option in neuropathic pain. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SNRIs). It has FDA approval for treatment of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and for the treatment of pain related to diabetic neuropathy, with effect found to be significant by the end of week 1 (effect measured as a 30% reduction in baseline pain). The starting dose is 20-60 mg/day, and no advantage has been found by increasing the dose to twice a day, except in fibromyalgia. The medication has been found to be effective for treating fibromyalgia in women with and without depression, 60 mg once or twice daily. (Arnold, 2005) The most frequent side effects include nausea, dizziness and fatigue. GI symptoms are more common early in treatment. The side effect profile of Duloxetine is thought to be less bothersome to patients than that of tricyclic antidepressants. Note: On October 17, 2005, Eli Lilly and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified healthcare professionals of revision to the PRECAUTIONS/ Hepatotoxicity section of the prescribing information for Cymbalta. Postmarketing reports of hepatic injury (including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice) suggest that patients with preexisting liver disease who take duloxetine may have an increased risk for further liver damage. The new labeling extends the Precaution against using Cymbalta in patients with substantial alcohol use to include those patients with chronic liver disease. It is recommended that Cymbalta not be administered to patients with hepatic insufficiency. See also Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Duloxetine listing for more information and references. On June 13, 2008, the FDA approved a new indication for duloxetine HCl delayed-release capsules (Cymbalta; Eli Lilly and Company) for the management of fibromyalgia in adults. The FDA notes that although duloxetine was effective for reducing pain in patients with and without major depressive disorder, the degree of pain relief may have been greater in those with comorbid depression. Treatment of fibromyalgia with duloxetine should be initiated at 30 mg/day for 1 week and then uptitrated to the recommended 60-mg dose. (Waknine, 2008) Note: This drug was recently included in a list of 20 medications identified by the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, that are under FDA investigation. (FDA, 2008)<br>

			Duloxetine (Cymbalta): FDA-approved for anxiety, depression, diabetic neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. Used off-label for neuropathic pain and radiculopathy. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line option for diabetic neuropathy. (Dworkin, 2007) No high quality evidence is reported to support the use of duloxetine for lumbar radiculopathy. (Dworkin, 2007) More studies are needed to determine the efficacy of duloxetine for other types of neuropathic pain.<br>
			Side effects: CNS: dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, drowsiness, anxiety (3% vs.2% for placebo), insomnia (8-13% vs. 6-7% for placebo). GI: nausea and vomiting (5-30%), weight loss (2%). Duloxetine can worsen diabetic control in some patients. It also causes sexual dysfunction. (Maizels, 2005)<br>

			Duragesic (fentanyl transdermal system)<br>
			Not recommended as a first-line therapy. Duragesic is the trade name of a fentanyl transdermal therapeutic system, which releases fentanyl, a potent opioid, slowly through the skin. It is manufactured by ALZA Corporation and marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica (both subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson). The FDA-approved product labeling states that Duragesic is indicated in the management of chronic pain in patients who require continuous opioid analgesia for pain that cannot be managed by other means. See Fentanyl.<br>
			Opioids, specific drug list<br>
			Fentanyl transdermal (Duragesic; generic available): Indicated for management of persistent chronic pain, which is moderate to severe requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid therapy. The pain cannot be managed by other means (e.g., NSAIDS). Note: Duragesic should only be used in patients who are currently on opioid therapy for which tolerance has developed. The patches should be applied to INTACT skin only. Side Effects: See opioid adverse effects. Analgesic dose: The previous opioid therapy for which tolerance has occurred should be at least equivalent to fentanyl 25mcg/h. Patches are worn for a 72 hour period. (Product information, Purdue Pharma)<br>
			Opioids, criteria for use<br>
			CRITERIA FOR USE OF OPIOIDS<br>
			4) On&ndash;Going Management. Actions Should Include:<br>
			(a) Prescriptions from a single practitioner taken as directed, and all prescriptions from a single pharmacy.<br>
			(b) The lowest possible dose should be prescribed to improve pain and function.<br>
			(c) Office: Ongoing review and documentation of pain relief, functional status, appropriate medication use, and side effects. Pain assessment should include: current pain; the least reported pain over the period since last assessment; average pain; intensity of pain after taking the opioid; how long it takes for pain relief; and how long pain relief lasts. Satisfactory response to treatment may be indicated by the patient's decreased pain, increased level of function, or improved quality of life. Information from family members or other caregivers should be considered in determining the patient's response to treatment. The 4 A's for Ongoing Monitoring: Four domains have been proposed as most relevant for ongoing monitoring of chronic pain patients on opioids: pain relief, side effects, physical and psychosocial functioning, and the occurrence of any potentially aberrant (or nonadherent) drug&ndash;related behaviors. These domains have been summarized as the &quot;4 A's&quot; (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, and aberrant drug&ndash;taking behaviors). The monitoring of these outcomes over time should affect therapeutic decisions and provide a framework for documentation of the clinical use of these controlled drugs. (Passik, 2000)<br>
			(d) Home: To aid in pain and functioning assessment, the patient should be requested to keep a pain dairy that includes entries such as pain triggers, and incidence of end&ndash;of&ndash;dose pain. It should be emphasized that using this diary will help in tailoring the opioid dose. This should not be a requirement for pain management.
			(e) Use of drug screening or inpatient treatment with issues of abuse, addiction, or poor pain control.<br>
			(f) Documentation of misuse of medications (doctor&ndash;shopping, uncontrolled drug escalation, drug diversion).<br>
			(g) Continuing review of overall situation with regard to nonopioid means of pain control.<br>
			(h) Consideration of a consultation with a multidisciplinary pain clinic if doses of opioids are required beyond what is usually required for the condition or pain does not improve on opioids in 3 months. Consider a psych consult if there is evidence of depression, anxiety or irritability. Consider an addiction medicine consult if there is evidence of substance misuse.<br>
			6) When to Discontinue Opioids: See Opioid hyperalgesia. Also see Weaning of Medications. Prior to discontinuing, it should be determined that the patient has not had treatment failure due to causes that can be corrected such as under&ndash;dosing or inappropriate dosing schedule. Weaning should occur under direct ongoing medical supervision as a slow taper except for the below mentioned possible indications for immediate discontinuation. The patient should not be abandoned.<br>
			(a) If there is no overall improvement in function, unless there are extenuating circumstances<br>
			(b) Continuing pain with the evidence of intolerable adverse effects<br>
			(c) Decrease in functioning<br>
			(d) Resolution of pain<br>
			(e) If serious non&ndash;adherence is occurring<br>
			(f) The patient requests discontinuing<br>
			(g) Immediate discontinuation has been suggested for: evidence of illegal activity including diversion, prescription forgery, or stealing; the patient is involved in a motor vehicle accident and/or arrest related to opioids, illicit drugs and/or alcohol; intentional suicide attempt; aggressive or threatening behavior in the clinic. It is suggested that a patient be given a 30&ndash;day supply of medications (to facilitate finding other treatment) or be started on a slow weaning schedule if a decision is made by the physician to terminate prescribing of opioids/controlled substances.<br>
			(h) Many physicians will allow one &quot;slip&quot; from a medication contract without immediate termination of opioids/controlled substances, with the consequences being a re&ndash;discussion of the clinic policy on controlled substances, including the consequences of repeat violations.<br>
			(i) If there are repeated violations from the medication contract or any other evidence of abuse, addiction, or possible diversion it has been suggested that a patient show evidence of a consult with a physician that is trained in addiction to assess the ongoing situation and recommend possible detoxification. (Weaver, 2002)<br>
			(j) When the patient is requesting opioid medications for their pain and inconsistencies are identified in the history, presentation, behaviors or physical findings, physicians and surgeons who make a clinical decision to withhold opioid medications should document the basis for their decision.<br>
			7) When to Continue Opioids<br>
			(a) If the patient has returned to work<br>
			(b) If the patient has improved functioning and pain (Washington, 2002) (Colorado, 2002) (Ontario, 2000) (VA/DoD, 2003) (Maddox&ndash;AAPM/APS, 1997) (Wisconsin, 2004) (Warfield, 2004)<br>

			Epidural steroid injections (ESIs)<br/>
			Recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain (defined as pain in dermatomal distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy). See specific criteria for use below. Most current guidelines recommend no more than 2 ESI injections. This is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a &quot;series of three&quot; ESIs. These early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Research has now shown that, on average, less than two injections are required for a successful ESI outcome. Current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection, and a third ESI is rarely recommended. Epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts, including continuing a home exercise program. There is little information on improved function. The American Academy of Neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between 2 and 6 weeks following the injection, but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months, and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain. (Armon, 2007) See also Epidural steroid injections, &quot;series of three.&quot;<br>
			Criteria for the use of Epidural steroid injections:<br>
			Note: The purpose of ESI is to reduce pain and inflammation, restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs, and avoiding surgery, but this treatment alone offers no significant long-term functional benefit.<br>
			1) Radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and/or electrodiagnostic testing.<br>
			2) Initially unresponsive to conservative treatment (exercises, physical methods, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants).<br>
			3) Injections should be performed using fluoroscopy (live x-ray) for guidance.<br>
			4) If used for diagnostic purposes, a maximum of two injections should be performed. A second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block. Diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections.<br>
			5) No more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks.<br>
			6) No more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session.<br>
			7) In the therapeutic phase, repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement, including at least 50% pain relief with associated reduction of medication use for six to eight weeks, with a general recommendation of no more than 4 blocks per region per year. (Manchikanti, 2003) (CMS, 2004) (Boswell, 2007)<br>
			8) Current research does not support a &quot;series-of-three&quot; injections in either the diagnostic or therapeutic phase. We recommend no more than 2 ESI injections.

			Lidoderm (lidocaine patch)<br>
			Lidoderm is the brand name for a lidocaine patch produced by Endo Pharmaceuticals. Topical lidocaine may be recommended for localized peripheral pain after there has been evidence of a trial of first-line therapy (tri-cyclic or SNRI anti-depressants or an AED such as gabapentin or Lyrica). This is not a first-line treatment and is only FDA approved for post-herpetic neuralgia. Further research is needed to recommend this treatment for chronic neuropathic pain disorders other than post-herpetic neuralgia. Formulations that do not involve a dermal-patch system are generally indicated as local anesthetics and anti-pruritics. For more information and references, see Topical analgesics.<br>
			Topical Analgesics<br>
			Recommended as an option as indicated below. Largely experimental in use with few randomized controlled trials to determine efficacy or safety. Primarily recommended for neuropathic pain when trials of antidepressants and anticonvulsants have failed. (Namaka, 2004) These agents are applied locally to painful areas with advantages that include lack of systemic side effects, absence of drug interactions, and no need to titrate. (Colombo, 2006) Many agents are compounded as monotherapy or in combination for pain control (including NSAIDs, opioids, capsaicin, local anesthetics, antidepressants, glutamate receptor antagonists, a-adrenergic receptor agonist, adenosine, cannabinoids, cholinergic receptor agonists, gamma agonists, prostanoids, bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate, biogenic amines, and nerve growth factor). (Argoff, 2006) There is little to no research to support the use of many of these agents. Any compounded product that contains at least one drug (or drug class) that is not recommended is not recommended. The use of these compounded agents requires knowledge of the specific analgesic effect of each agent and how it will be useful for the specific therapeutic goal required. [Note: Topical analgesics work locally underneath the skin where they are applied. These do not include transdermal analgesics that are systemic agents entering the body through a transdermal means. See Duragesic (fentanyl transdermal system).]<br>
			Lidocaine Indication: Neuropathic pain Recommended for localized peripheral pain after there has been evidence of a trial of first-line therapy (tri-cyclic or SNRI anti-depressants or an AED such as gabapentin or Lyrica). Topical lidocaine, in the formulation of a dermal patch (Lidoderm) has been designated for orphan status by the FDA for neuropathic pain. Lidoderm is also used off-label for diabetic neuropathy. No other commercially approved topical formulations of lidocaine (whether creams, lotions or gels) are indicated for neuropathic pain. Non-dermal patch formulations are generally indicated as local anesthetics and anti-pruritics. Further research is needed to recommend this treatment for chronic neuropathic pain disorders other than post-herpetic neuralgia. Formulations that do not involve a dermal-patch system are generally indicated as local anesthetics and anti-pruritics. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of the use of topical lidocaine. Those at particular risk were individuals that applied large amounts of this substance over large areas, left the products on for long periods of time, or used the agent with occlusive dressings. Systemic exposure was highly variable among patients. Only FDA-approved products are currently recommended. (Argoff, 2006) (Dworkin, 2007) (Khaliq-Cochrane, 2007) (Knotkova, 2007) (Lexi-Comp, 2008) Non-neuropathic pain: Not recommended. There is only one trial that tested 4% lidocaine for treatment of chronic muscle pain. The results showed there was no superiority over placebo. (Scudds, 1995)<br>

(Colombo, 2006) Many agents are compounded as monotherapy or in combination for pain control (including NSAIDs, opioids, capsaicin, local anesthetics, antidepressants, glutamate receptor antagonists, a-adrenergic receptor agonist, adenosine, cannabinoids, cholinergic receptor agonists, gamma agonists, prostanoids, bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate, biogenic amines, and nerve growth factor). (Argoff, 2006) There is little to no research to support the use of many of these agents. Any compounded product that contains at least one drug (or drug class) that is not recommended is not recommended. The use of these compounded agents requires knowledge of the specific analgesic effect of each agent and how it will be useful for the specific therapeutic goal required. [Note: Topical analgesics work locally underneath the skin where they are applied. These do not include transdermal analgesics that are systemic agents entering the body through a transdermal means. See Duragesic (fentanyl transdermal system).]<br>
			Capsaicin: Recommended only as an option in patients who have not responded or are intolerant to other treatments. Formulations: Capsaicin is generally available as a 0.025% formulation (as a treatment for osteoarthritis) and a 0.075% formulation (primarily studied for post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and post-mastectomy pain). There have been no studies of a 0.0375% formulation of capsaicin and there is no current indication that this increase over a 0.025% formulation would provide any further efficacy. Indications: There are positive randomized studies with capsaicin cream in patients with osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and chronic non-specific back pain, but it should be considered experimental in very high doses. Although topical capsaicin has moderate to poor efficacy, it may be particularly useful (alone or in conjunction with other modalities) in patients whose pain has not been controlled successfully with conventional therapy. The number needed to treat in musculoskeletal conditions was 8.1. The number needed to treat for neuropathic conditions was 5.7. (Robbins, 2000) (Keitel, 2001) (Mason-BMJ, 2004) See also Capsaicin.<br>

			Mechanism of action: Capsaicin, which is derived from chili peppers, causes vasodilation, itching, and burning when applied to the skin. These actions are attributed to binding with nociceptors, which causes a period of enhanced sensitivity followed by a refractory period of reduced sensitivity. Topical capsaicin is superior to placebo in relieving chronic neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. Capsaicin produces highly selective regional anesthesia by causing degeneration of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive nerve endings, which can produce significant and long lasting increases in nociceptive thresholds. (Maroon, 2006)<br>
			Adverse reactions: Local adverse reactions were common (one out of three patients) but seldom serious (burning, stinging, erythema). Coughing has also been reported. See also CRPS, medications; Topical analgesics.<br>

Oyxcontin tablets are NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. Side Effects: See opioid adverse effects. Analgesic dose: (Immediate release tablets) 5mg every 6 hours as needed. Controlled release: In opioid naive patients the starting dose is 10mg every 12 hours. Doses should be tailored for each individual patient, factoring in medical condition, the patient's prior opioid exposure, and other analgesics the patient may be taking. See full prescribing information to calculate conversions from other opioids. Note: See manufacturer's special instructions for prescribing doses of over 80mg and 160mg. Dietary caution: patients taking 160mg tablets should be advised to avoid high fat meals due to an increase in peak plasma concentration. (Product information, Purdue Pharma)<br>

			CRITERIA FOR USE OF OPIOIDS<br>
			4) On&ndash;Going Management. Actions Should Include:<br>
			(a) Prescriptions from a single practitioner taken as directed, and all prescriptions from a single pharmacy.<br>
			(b) The lowest possible dose should be prescribed to improve pain and function.<br>
			(c) Office: Ongoing review and documentation of pain relief, functional status, appropriate medication use, and side effects. Pain assessment should include: current pain; the least reported pain over the period since last assessment; average pain; intensity of pain after taking the opioid; how long it takes for pain relief; and how long pain relief lasts. Satisfactory response to treatment may be indicated by the patient's decreased pain, increased level of function, or improved quality of life. Information from family members or other caregivers should be considered in determining the patient's response to treatment. The 4 A's for Ongoing Monitoring: Four domains have been proposed as most relevant for ongoing monitoring of chronic pain patients on opioids: pain relief, side effects, physical and psychosocial functioning, and the occurrence of any potentially aberrant (or nonadherent) drug&ndash;related behaviors. These domains have been summarized as the &quot;4 A's&quot; (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, and aberrant drug&ndash;taking behaviors). The monitoring of these outcomes over time should affect therapeutic decisions and provide a framework for documentation of the clinical use of these controlled drugs. (Passik, 2000)<br>
			(d) Home: To aid in pain and functioning assessment, the patient should be requested to keep a pain dairy that includes entries such as pain triggers, and incidence of end&ndash;of&ndash;dose pain. It should be emphasized that using this diary will help in tailoring the opioid dose. This should not be a requirement for pain management.
			(e) Use of drug screening or inpatient treatment with issues of abuse, addiction, or poor pain control.<br>
			(f) Documentation of misuse of medications (doctor&ndash;shopping, uncontrolled drug escalation, drug diversion).<br>
			(g) Continuing review of overall situation with regard to nonopioid means of pain control.<br>
			(h) Consideration of a consultation with a multidisciplinary pain clinic if doses of opioids are required beyond what is usually required for the condition or pain does not improve on opioids in 3 months. Consider a psych consult if there is evidence of depression, anxiety or irritability. Consider an addiction medicine consult if there is evidence of substance misuse.<br>
			6) When to Discontinue Opioids: See Opioid hyperalgesia. Also see Weaning of Medications. Prior to discontinuing, it should be determined that the patient has not had treatment failure due to causes that can be corrected such as under&ndash;dosing or inappropriate dosing schedule. Weaning should occur under direct ongoing medical supervision as a slow taper except for the below mentioned possible indications for immediate discontinuation. The patient should not be abandoned.<br>
			(a) If there is no overall improvement in function, unless there are extenuating circumstances<br>
			(b) Continuing pain with the evidence of intolerable adverse effects<br>
			(c) Decrease in functioning<br>
			(d) Resolution of pain<br>
			(e) If serious non&ndash;adherence is occurring<br>
			(f) The patient requests discontinuing<br>
			(g) Immediate discontinuation has been suggested for: evidence of illegal activity including diversion, prescription forgery, or stealing; the patient is involved in a motor vehicle accident and/or arrest related to opioids, illicit drugs and/or alcohol; intentional suicide attempt; aggressive or threatening behavior in the clinic. It is suggested that a patient be given a 30&ndash;day supply of medications (to facilitate finding other treatment) or be started on a slow weaning schedule if a decision is made by the physician to terminate prescribing of opioids/controlled substances.<br>
			(h) Many physicians will allow one &quot;slip&quot; from a medication contract without immediate termination of opioids/controlled substances, with the consequences being a re&ndash;discussion of the clinic policy on controlled substances, including the consequences of repeat violations.<br>
			(i) If there are repeated violations from the medication contract or any other evidence of abuse, addiction, or possible diversion it has been suggested that a patient show evidence of a consult with a physician that is trained in addiction to assess the ongoing situation and recommend possible detoxification.

			Recommended as indicated below. Passive therapy (those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient) can provide short term relief during the early phases of pain treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation and swelling and to improve the rate of healing soft tissue injuries. They can be used sparingly with active therapies to help control swelling, pain and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. Active therapy is based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task. This form of therapy may require supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). Patients are instructed and expected to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. (Colorado, 2002) (Airaksinen, 2006) Patient&ndash;specific hand therapy is very important in reducing swelling, decreasing pain, and improving range of motion in CRPS. (Li, 2005) The use of active treatment modalities (e.g., exercise, education, activity modification) instead of passive treatments is associated with substantially better clinical outcomes. In a large case series of patients with low back pain treated by physical therapists, those adhering to guidelines for active rather than passive treatments incurred fewer treatment visits, cost less, and had less pain and less disability. The overall success rates were 64.7% among those adhering to the active treatment recommendations versus 36.5% for passive treatment. (Fritz, 2007)<br>

                Patient rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury is divided into two periods: acute and subacute. In the beginning of rehabilitation therapist evaluates patient's functional status, later he uses methods and means of treatment, and evaluates effectiveness of rehabilitation. Early ambulation is very important for patients with coma. Therapy consists of prevention of complications, improvement of muscle force, and range of motions, balance, movement coordination, endurance and cognitive functions. Early rehabilitation is necessary for traumatic brain injury patients and use of therapy methods can help to regain lost functions and to come back to the society.

                Used after surgery and amputation. During immobilization, there was weak evidence of improved hand function in the short term, but not in the longer term, for early occupational therapy, and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises. Post-immobilization, there was weak evidence of a lack of clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving formal rehabilitation therapy, passive mobilization or whirlpool immersion compared with no intervention. There was weak evidence of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion (post external fixation), intermittent pneumatic compression and ultrasound. There was weak evidence of better short-term hand function in patients given therapy than in those given instructions for home exercises by a surgeon.

            Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>
            <p>
                Recommended as indicated below. There is limited evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PT (physical therapy) or OT (occupational therapy) for CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome). The evidence may justify 3 to 5 visits over 4 weeks after surgery, up to the maximums shown below. Benefits need to be documented after the first week, and prolonged therapy visits are not supported. Carpal tunnel syndrome should not result in extended time off work while undergoing multiple therapy visits, when other options (including surgery for carefully selected patients) could result in faster return to work. Furthermore, carpal tunnel release surgery is a relatively simple operation that also should not require extended multiple therapy office visits for recovery. Of course, these statements do not apply to cases of failed surgery and/or misdiagnosis (e.g., CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) I instead of CTS). (Feuerstein, 1999) (O'Conner-Cochrane, 2003) (Verhagen-Cochrane, 2004) (APTA, 2006) (Bilic, 2006) Post surgery, a home therapy program is superior to extended splinting. (Cook, 1995) Continued visits should be contingent on documentation of objective improvement, i.e., VAS (visual analog scale) improvement greater than four, and long-term resolution of symptoms. Therapy should include education in a home program, work discussion and suggestions for modifications, lifestyle changes, and setting realistic expectations. Passive modalities, such as heat, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, ultrasound and electrical stimulation, should be minimized in favor of active treatments.<br>

                As compared with no therapy, therapy (up to 20 sessions over 12 weeks) following disc herniation surgery was effective. Because of the limited benefits of therapy relative to massage, it is open to question whether this treatment acts primarily physiologically, but psychological factors may contribute substantially to the benefits observed.

                A therapy program that starts immediately following hip surgery allows for greater improvement in muscle strength, walking speed and functional score. (Jan, 2004) (Jain, 2002) (Penrod, 2004) (Tsauo, 2005) (Brigham, 2003) (White, 2005) (National, 2003) A weight-bearing exercise program can improve balance and functional ability to a greater extent than a non-weight-bearing program. (Expert, 2004) (Binder, 2004) (Bolgla, 2005) (Handoll, 2004) (Kuisma, 2002) (Lauridsen, 2002) (Mangione, 2005) (Sherrington, 2004) Patients with hip fracture should be offered a coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation program with the specific aim of regaining sufficient function to return to their pre-fracture living arrangements. (Cameron, 2005) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

            <p>
                Controversy exists about the effectiveness of therapy after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. (Goodwin, 2003) Functional exercises after hospital discharge for total knee arthroplasty result in a small to moderate short-term, but not long-term, benefit. In the short term therapy interventions with exercises based on functional activities may be more effective after total knee arthroplasty than traditional exercise programs, which concentrate on isometric muscle exercises and exercises to increase range of motion in the joint. (Minns Lowe, 2007) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

			Topical Analgesics<br>
			Recommended as an option as indicated below. Largely experimental in use with few randomized controlled trials to determine efficacy or safety. Primarily recommended for neuropathic pain when trials of antidepressants and anticonvulsants have failed. (Namaka, 2004) These agents are applied locally to painful areas with advantages that include lack of systemic side effects, absence of drug interactions, and no need to titrate. (Colombo, 2006) Many agents are compounded as monotherapy or in combination for pain control (including NSAIDs, opioids, capsaicin, local anesthetics, antidepressants, glutamate receptor antagonists, a-adrenergic receptor agonist, adenosine, cannabinoids, cholinergic receptor agonists, gamma agonists, prostanoids, bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate, biogenic amines, and nerve growth factor). (Argoff, 2006) There is little to no research to support the use of many of these agents. Any compounded product that contains at least one drug (or drug class) that is not recommended is not recommended. The use of these compounded agents requires knowledge of the specific analgesic effect of each agent and how it will be useful for the specific therapeutic goal required. [Note: Topical analgesics work locally underneath the skin where they are applied. These do not include transdermal analgesics that are systemic agents entering the body through a transdermal means. See Duragesic (fentanyl transdermal system).]<br>
			Lidocaine Indication: Neuropathic pain Recommended for localized peripheral pain after there has been evidence of a trial of first-line therapy (tri-cyclic or SNRI anti-depressants or an AED such as gabapentin or Lyrica). Topical lidocaine, in the formulation of a dermal patch (Lidoderm) has been designated for orphan status by the FDA for neuropathic pain. Lidoderm is also used off-label for diabetic neuropathy. No other commercially approved topical formulations of lidocaine (whether creams, lotions or gels) are indicated for neuropathic pain. Non-dermal patch formulations are generally indicated as local anesthetics and anti-pruritics. Further research is needed to recommend this treatment for chronic neuropathic pain disorders other than post-herpetic neuralgia. Formulations that do not involve a dermal-patch system are generally indicated as local anesthetics and anti-pruritics. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of the use of topical lidocaine. Those at particular risk were individuals that applied large amounts of this substance over large areas, left the products on for long periods of time, or used the agent with occlusive dressings. Systemic exposure was highly variable among patients. Only FDA-approved products are currently recommended. (Argoff, 2006) (Dworkin, 2007) (Khaliq-Cochrane, 2007) (Knotkova, 2007) (Lexi-Comp, 2008) Non-neuropathic pain: Not recommended. There is only one trial that tested 4% lidocaine for treatment of chronic muscle pain. The results showed there was no superiority over placebo. (Scudds, 1995)<br>
			Capsaicin: Recommended only as an option in patients who have not responded or are intolerant to other treatments. Formulations: Capsaicin is generally available as a 0.025% formulation (as a treatment for osteoarthritis) and a 0.075% formulation (primarily studied for post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and post-mastectomy pain). There have been no studies of a 0.0375% formulation of capsaicin and there is no current indication that this increase over a 0.025% formulation would provide any further efficacy. Indications: There are positive randomized studies with capsaicin cream in patients with osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and chronic non-specific back pain, but it should be considered experimental in very high doses. Although topical capsaicin has moderate to poor efficacy, it may be particularly useful (alone or in conjunction with other modalities) in patients whose pain has not been controlled successfully with conventional therapy. The number needed to treat in musculoskeletal conditions was 8.1. The number needed to treat for neuropathic conditions was 5.7. (Robbins, 2000) (Keitel, 2001) (Mason-BMJ, 2004) See also Capsaicin.<br>

			Mechanism of action: Capsaicin, which is derived from chili peppers, causes vasodilation, itching, and burning when applied to the skin. These actions are attributed to binding with nociceptors, which causes a period of enhanced sensitivity followed by a refractory period of reduced sensitivity. Topical capsaicin is superior to placebo in relieving chronic neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. Capsaicin produces highly selective regional anesthesia by causing degeneration of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive nerve endings, which can produce significant and long lasting increases in nociceptive thresholds. (Maroon, 2006)<br>
			Adverse reactions: Local adverse reactions were common (one out of three patients) but seldom serious (burning, stinging, erythema). Coughing has also been reported. See also CRPS, medications; Topical analgesics.<br>
			Salicylate topicals<br>
			Recommended. Topical salicylate (e.g., Ben-Gay, methyl salicylate) is significantly better than placebo in chronic pain. (Mason-BMJ, 2004) See also Topical analgesics; & Topical analgesics, compounded.<br>

			Muscle relaxants (for pain)<br>
			Recommend non-sedating muscle relaxants with caution as a second-line option for short-term treatment of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic LBP. (Chou, 2007) (Mens, 2005) (Van Tulder, 1998) (van Tulder, 2003) (van Tulder, 2006) (Schnitzer, 2004) (See, 2008) Muscle relaxants may be effective in reducing pain and muscle tension, and increasing mobility. However, in most LBP cases, they show no benefit beyond NSAIDs in pain and overall improvement. Also there is no additional benefit shown in combination with NSAIDs. Efficacy appears to diminish over time, and prolonged use of some medications in this class may lead to dependence. (Homik, 2004) Sedation is the most commonly reported adverse effect of muscle relaxant medications. These drugs should be used with caution in patients driving motor vehicles or operating heavy machinery. Drugs with the most limited published evidence in terms of clinical effectiveness include chlorzoxazone, methocarbamol, dantrolene and baclofen. (Chou, 2004) According to a recent review in American Family Physician, skeletal muscle relaxants are the most widely prescribed drug class for musculoskeletal conditions (18.5% of prescriptions), and the most commonly prescribed antispasmodic agents are carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol, but despite their popularity, skeletal muscle relaxants should not be the primary drug class of choice for musculoskeletal conditions. (See2, 2008)<br> 
			ANTISPASTICITY/ANTISPASMODIC DRUGS:<br>
			Tizanidine (Zanaflex, generic available) is a centrally acting alpha2-adrenergic agonist that is FDA approved for management of spasticity; unlabeled use for low back pain. (Malanga, 2008) Eight studies have demonstrated efficacy for low back pain. (Chou, 2007) One study (conducted only in females) demonstrated a significant decrease in pain associated with chronic myofascial pain syndrome and the authors recommended its use as a first line option to treat myofascial pain. (Malanga, 2002) May also provide benefit as an adjunct treatment for fibromyalgia. (ICSI, 2007)<br>
			Side effects: somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, hypotension, weakness, hepatotoxicity (LFTs should be monitored baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months). (See, 2008)<br>
			Dosing: 4 mg initial dose; titrate gradually by 2 &ndash; 4 mg every 6 &ndash; 8 hours until therapeutic effect with tolerable side-effects; maximum 36 mg per day. (See, 2008) Use with caution in renal impairment; should be avoided in hepatic impairment. Tizanidine use has been associated with hepatic aminotransaminase elevations that are usually asymptomatic and reversible with discontinuation. <br>

			&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			Tramadol (Ultram)<br>
			Tramadol (Ultram) is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and it is not recommended as a first-line oral analgesic. For more information and references, see Opioids. See also Opioids for neuropathic pain.<br>
			Opioids, specific drug list<br> 
			Tramadol (UltramÂ®; Ultram ER; generic available in immediate release tablet): Tramadol is a synthetic opioid affecting the central nervous system. Tramadol is not classified as a controlled substance by the DEA. Side Effects: Dizziness, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, flushing, pruritus, vomiting, insomnia, dry mouth, and diarrhea. Tramadol may increase the risk of seizure especially in patients taking SSRIs, TCAs and other opioids. Do not prescribe to patients that at risk for suicide or addiction. Warning: Tramadol may produce life-threatening serotonin syndrome, in particular when used concomitantly with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs, and triptans or other drugs that may impair serotonin metabolism. Analgesic dose: Tramadol is indicated for moderate to severe pain. The immediate release formulation is recommended at a dose of 50 to 100mg PO every 4 to 6 hours (not to exceed 400mg/day). This dose is recommended after titrating patients up from 100mg/day, with dosing being increased every 3 days as tolerated. For patients in need of immediate pain relief, which outweighs the risk of non-tolerability the initial starting dose, may be 50mg to 100mg every 4 to 6 hours (max 400mg/day). Ultram ERÂ®: Patient currently not on immediate release tramadol should be started at a dose of 100mg once daily. The dose should be titrated upwards by 100mg increments if needed (Max dose 300mg/day). Patients currently on immediate release tramdadol, calculate the 24-hour dose of IR and initiate a total daily dose of ER rounded to the next lowest 100mg increment (Max dose 300mg/day). (Product information, Ortho-McNeil 2003) (Lexi-Comp, 2008)<br> 
			CRITERIA FOR USE OF OPIOIDS<br>
			4) On&ndash;Going Management. Actions Should Include:<br>
			(a) Prescriptions from a single practitioner taken as directed, and all prescriptions from a single pharmacy.<br>
			(b) The lowest possible dose should be prescribed to improve pain and function.<br>
			(c) Office: Ongoing review and documentation of pain relief, functional status, appropriate medication use, and side effects. Pain assessment should include: current pain; the least reported pain over the period since last assessment; average pain; intensity of pain after taking the opioid; how long it takes for pain relief; and how long pain relief lasts. Satisfactory response to treatment may be indicated by the patient's decreased pain, increased level of function, or improved quality of life. Information from family members or other caregivers should be considered in determining the patient's response to treatment. The 4 A's for Ongoing Monitoring: Four domains have been proposed as most relevant for ongoing monitoring of chronic pain patients on opioids: pain relief, side effects, physical and psychosocial functioning, and the occurrence of any potentially aberrant (or nonadherent) drug&ndash;related behaviors. These domains have been summarized as the &quot;4 A's&quot; (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, and aberrant drug&ndash;taking behaviors). The monitoring of these outcomes over time should affect therapeutic decisions and provide a framework for documentation of the clinical use of these controlled drugs. (Passik, 2000)<br>
			(d) Home: To aid in pain and functioning assessment, the patient should be requested to keep a pain dairy that includes entries such as pain triggers, and incidence of end&ndash;of&ndash;dose pain. It should be emphasized that using this diary will help in tailoring the opioid dose. This should not be a requirement for pain management.
			(e) Use of drug screening or inpatient treatment with issues of abuse, addiction, or poor pain control.<br>
			(f) Documentation of misuse of medications (doctor&ndash;shopping, uncontrolled drug escalation, drug diversion).<br>
			(g) Continuing review of overall situation with regard to nonopioid means of pain control.<br>
			(h) Consideration of a consultation with a multidisciplinary pain clinic if doses of opioids are required beyond what is usually required for the condition or pain does not improve on opioids in 3 months. Consider a psych consult if there is evidence of depression, anxiety or irritability. Consider an addiction medicine consult if there is evidence of substance misuse.<br>
			6) When to Discontinue Opioids: See Opioid hyperalgesia. Also see Weaning of Medications. Prior to discontinuing, it should be determined that the patient has not had treatment failure due to causes that can be corrected such as under&ndash;dosing or inappropriate dosing schedule. Weaning should occur under direct ongoing medical supervision as a slow taper except for the below mentioned possible indications for immediate discontinuation. The patient should not be abandoned.<br>
			(a) If there is no overall improvement in function, unless there are extenuating circumstances<br>
			(b) Continuing pain with the evidence of intolerable adverse effects<br>
			(c) Decrease in functioning<br>
			(d) Resolution of pain<br>
			(e) If serious non&ndash;adherence is occurring<br>
			(f) The patient requests discontinuing<br>
			(g) Immediate discontinuation has been suggested for: evidence of illegal activity including diversion, prescription forgery, or stealing; the patient is involved in a motor vehicle accident and/or arrest related to opioids, illicit drugs and/or alcohol; intentional suicide attempt; aggressive or threatening behavior in the clinic. It is suggested that a patient be given a 30&ndash;day supply of medications (to facilitate finding other treatment) or be started on a slow weaning schedule if a decision is made by the physician to terminate prescribing of opioids/controlled substances.<br>
			(h) Many physicians will allow one &quot;slip&quot; from a medication contract without immediate termination of opioids/controlled substances, with the consequences being a re&ndash;discussion of the clinic policy on controlled substances, including the consequences of repeat violations.<br>
			(i) If there are repeated violations from the medication contract or any other evidence of abuse, addiction, or possible diversion it has been suggested that a patient show evidence of a consult with a physician that is trained in addiction to assess the ongoing situation and recommend possible detoxification. (Weaver, 2002)<br>
			(j) When the patient is requesting opioid medications for their pain and inconsistencies are identified in the history, presentation, behaviors or physical findings, physicians and surgeons who make a clinical decision to withhold opioid medications should document the basis for their decision.<br>
			7) When to Continue Opioids<br>
			(a) If the patient has returned to work<br>
			(b) If the patient has improved functioning and pain (Washington, 2002) (Colorado, 2002) (Ontario, 2000) (VA/DoD, 2003) (Maddox&ndash;AAPM/APS, 1997) (Wisconsin, 2004) (Warfield, 2004)<br>
