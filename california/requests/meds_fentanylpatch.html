		&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br />
		Duragesic (fentanyl transdermal system)<br />
		Not recommended as a first-line therapy. Duragesic is the trade name of a fentanyl transdermal therapeutic system, which releases fentanyl, a potent opioid, slowly through the skin. It is manufactured by ALZA Corporation and marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica (both subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson). The FDA-approved product labeling states that Duragesic is indicated in the management of chronic pain in patients who require continuous opioid analgesia for pain that cannot be managed by other means. See Fentanyl.<br />
		Opioids, specific drug list<br />
		Fentanyl transdermal (Duragesic; generic available): Indicated for management of persistent chronic pain, which is moderate to severe requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid therapy. The pain cannot be managed by other means (e.g., NSAIDS). Note: Duragesic should only be used in patients who are currently on opioid therapy for which tolerance has developed. The patches should be applied to INTACT skin only. Side Effects: See opioid adverse effects. Analgesic dose: The previous opioid therapy for which tolerance has occurred should be at least equivalent to fentanyl 25mcg/h. Patches are worn for a 72 hour period.

		Opioids, criteria for use<br />
		CRITERIA FOR USE OF OPIOIDS<br />
		4) On&ndash;Going Management. Actions Should Include:<br />
		(a) Prescriptions from a single practitioner taken as directed, and all prescriptions from a single pharmacy.<br />
		(b) The lowest possible dose should be prescribed to improve pain and function.<br />
		(c) Office: Ongoing review and documentation of pain relief, functional status, appropriate medication use, and side effects. Pain assessment should include: current pain; the least reported pain over the period since last assessment; average pain; intensity of pain after taking the opioid; how long it takes for pain relief; and how long pain relief lasts. Satisfactory response to treatment may be indicated by the patient's decreased pain, increased level of function, or improved quality of life. Information from family members or other caregivers should be considered in determining the patient's response to treatment. The 4 A's for Ongoing Monitoring: Four domains have been proposed as most relevant for ongoing monitoring of chronic pain patients on opioids: pain relief, side effects, physical and psychosocial functioning, and the occurrence of any potentially aberrant (or nonadherent) drug&ndash;related behaviors. These domains have been summarized as the &quot;4 A's&quot; (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, and aberrant drug&ndash;taking behaviors). The monitoring of these outcomes over time should affect therapeutic decisions and provide a framework for documentation of the clinical use of these controlled drugs. (Passik, 2000)<br />
		(d) Home: To aid in pain and functioning assessment, the patient should be requested to keep a pain dairy that includes entries such as pain triggers, and incidence of end&ndash;of&ndash;dose pain. It should be emphasized that using this diary will help in tailoring the opioid dose. This should not be a requirement for pain management.
		(e) Use of drug screening or inpatient treatment with issues of abuse, addiction, or poor pain control.<br />
		(f) Documentation of misuse of medications (doctor&ndash;shopping, uncontrolled drug escalation, drug diversion).<br />
		(g) Continuing review of overall situation with regard to nonopioid means of pain control.<br />
		(h) Consideration of a consultation with a multidisciplinary pain clinic if doses of opioids are required beyond what is usually required for the condition or pain does not improve on opioids in 3 months. Consider a psych consult if there is evidence of depression, anxiety or irritability. Consider an addiction medicine consult if there is evidence of substance misuse.<br />
		6) When to Discontinue Opioids: See Opioid hyperalgesia. Also see Weaning of Medications. Prior to discontinuing, it should be determined that the patient has not had treatment failure due to causes that can be corrected such as under&ndash;dosing or inappropriate dosing schedule. Weaning should occur under direct ongoing medical supervision as a slow taper except for the below mentioned possible indications for immediate discontinuation. The patient should not be abandoned.<br />
		(a) If there is no overall improvement in function, unless there are extenuating circumstances<br />
		(b) Continuing pain with the evidence of intolerable adverse effects<br />
		(c) Decrease in functioning<br />
		(d) Resolution of pain<br />
		(e) If serious non&ndash;adherence is occurring<br />
		(f) The patient requests discontinuing<br />
		(g) Immediate discontinuation has been suggested for: evidence of illegal activity including diversion, prescription forgery, or stealing; the patient is involved in a motor vehicle accident and/or arrest related to opioids, illicit drugs and/or alcohol; intentional suicide attempt; aggressive or threatening behavior in the clinic. It is suggested that a patient be given a 30&ndash;day supply of medications (to facilitate finding other treatment) or be started on a slow weaning schedule if a decision is made by the physician to terminate prescribing of opioids/controlled substances.<br />
		(h) Many physicians will allow one &quot;slip&quot; from a medication contract without immediate termination of opioids/controlled substances, with the consequences being a re&ndash;discussion of the clinic policy on controlled substances, including the consequences of repeat violations.<br />
		(i) If there are repeated violations from the medication contract or any other evidence of abuse, addiction, or possible diversion it has been suggested that a patient show evidence of a consult with a physician that is trained in addiction to assess the ongoing situation and recommend possible detoxification. (Weaver, 2002)<br />
		(j) When the patient is requesting opioid medications for their pain and inconsistencies are identified in the history, presentation, behaviors or physical findings, physicians and surgeons who make a clinical decision to withhold opioid medications should document the basis for their decision.<br />
		7) When to Continue Opioids<br />
		(a) If the patient has returned to work<br />
		(b) If the patient has improved functioning and pain (Washington, 2002) (Colorado, 2002) (Ontario, 2000) (VA/DoD, 2003) (Maddox&ndash;AAPM/APS, 1997) (Wisconsin, 2004) (Warfield, 2004)<br />
		Opioids, dosing<br />
		Recommend that dosing not exceed 120 mg oral morphine equivalents per day, and for patients taking more than one opioid, the morphine equivalent doses of the different opioids must be added together to determine the cumulative dose.<br />
		Opioid Dosing Calculator Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) factor:<br />
		Codeine &ndash; 0.15<br />
		Fentanyl transdermal (in mcg/hr) &ndash; 2.4<br />
		Hydrocodone &ndash; 1<br />
		Hydromorphone &ndash; 4<br />
		Methadone, 41 to 60mg per day &ndash; 10<br />
		Methadone, >60mg per day &ndash; 12<br />
		Morphine &ndash; 1<br />
		Oxycodone &ndash; 1.5<br />
		Oxymorphone &ndash; 3 <br />
