		&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br />
		Amitriptyline<br />
		Recommended. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. See Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Tricyclics listing for more information and references.<br /> 
		Antidepressants for chronic pain<br />
		Recommended as a first line option for neuropathic pain, and as a possibility for non-neuropathic pain. (Feuerstein, 1997) (Perrot, 2006) Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. Analgesia generally occurs within a few days to a week, whereas antidepressant effect takes longer to occur. (Saarto-Cochrane, 2005) Assessment of treatment efficacy should include not only pain outcomes, but also an evaluation of function, changes in use of other analgesic medication, sleep quality and duration, and psychological assessment. Side effects, including excessive sedation (especially that which would affect work performance) should be assessed. (Additional side effects are listed below for each specific drug.) It is recommended that these outcome measurements should be initiated at one week of treatment with a recommended trial of at least 4 weeks. The optimal duration of treatment is not known because most double-blind trials have been of short duration (6-12 weeks). It has been suggested that if pain is in remission for 3-6 months, a gradual tapering of anti-depressants may be undertaken. (Perrot, 2006) (Schnitzer, 2004) (Lin-JAMA, 2003) (Salerno, 2002) (Moulin, 2001) (Fishbain, 2000) (Taylor, 2004) (Gijsman, 2004) (Jick-JAMA, 2004) (Barbui, 2004) (Asnis, 2004) (Stein, 2003) (Pollack, 2003) (Ticknor, 2004) (Staiger, 2003) Long-term effectiveness of anti-depressants has not been established. (Wong, 2007) The effect of this class of medication in combination with other classes of drugs has not been well researched. (Finnerup, 2005) The "number needed to treat" (NNT) methodology (calculated as the reciprocal value of the response rate on active and placebo) has been used to calculate efficacy of the different classes of antidepressants. (Sindrup, 2005)<br />
		SPECIFIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS:<br />
		Tricyclic antidepressants are recommended over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), unless adverse reactions are a problem. Caution is required because tricyclics have a low threshold for toxicity, and tricyclic antidepressant overdose is a significant cause of fatal drug poisoning due to their cardiovascular and neurological effects. Tricyclic antidepressants have been shown in both a meta-analysis (McQuay, 1996) and a systematic review (Collins, 2000) to be effective, and are considered a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. (Namaka, 2004) (Dworkin, 2003) (Gilron, 2006) (Wolfe, 2004) (Dworkin, 2007) (Saarto-Cochrane, 2007) This class of medications works in both patients with normal mood and patients with depressed mood when used in treatment for neuropathic pain. (Sindrup, 2005) Indications in controlled trials have shown effectiveness in treating central post-stroke pain, post-herpetic neuralgia (Argoff, 2004), painful diabetic and non-diabetic polyneuropathy, and post-mastectomy pain. Negative results were found for spinal cord pain and phantom-limb pain, but this may have been due to study design. (Finnerup, 2005) Tricyclics have not demonstrated significance in randomized-control trials in treating HIV neuropathy, spinal cord injury, cisplatinum neuropathy, neuropathic cancer pain, phantom limb pain or chronic lumbar root pain. (Dworkin, 2007) One review reported the NNT for at least moderate neuropathic pain relief with tricyclics is 3.6 (3-4.5), with the NNT for amitriptyline being 3.1 (2.5-4.2). The NNT for venlafaxine, calculated using 3 studies, was reported to be 3.1 (2.2-5.1). (Saarto-Cochrane, 2007) Another review reported that the NNT for 50% improvement in neuropathic pain was 2 to 3 for tricyclic antidepressants, 4 for venlafaxine, and 7 for SSRIs (Perrot, 2008).<br />
		Side-effect profile: Tricyclics are contraindicated in patients with cardiac conduction disturbances and/or decompensation (they can produce heart block and arrhythmias) as well as for those patients with epilepsy. For patients > 40 years old, a screening ECG is recommended prior to initiation of therapy. (Dworkin, 2007) (ICSI, 2007) They can create anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth, sweating, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, constipation, and urinary retention. (Finnerup, 2005) To minimize side effects, it is suggested that titration should be slow and based on the patient's response. (Namaka, 2004) An alternative choice may be a SNRI. (Finnerup, 2005) (Sindrup, 2005) (Dworkin, 2007)<br />
		Dosing Information:<br />
		Amitriptyline: Neuropathic pain: The starting dose may be as low as 10-25 mg at night, with increases of 10-25 mg once or twice a week up to 100 mg/day. (ICSI, 2007) The lowest effective dose should be used (Dworkin, 2007). Fibromyalgia: One review recommended the following dosing regimen: Start with low doses, such as 5-10 mg 1-3 hours before bedtime. Dose may be increased by 5 mg at two-week intervals; final dose is dependent upon efficacy and patient tolerability to side effects. Doses that have been studied range from 25 to 50 mg at bedtime.
