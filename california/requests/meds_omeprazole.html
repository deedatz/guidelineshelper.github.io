		NSAIDs, GI symptoms & cardiovascular risk<br />
		Recommend with precautions as indicated below.<br />
		Clinicians should weight the indications for NSAIDs against both GI and cardiovascular risk factors. Determine if the patient is at risk for gastrointestinal events: (1) age > 65 years; (2) history of peptic ulcer, GI bleeding or perforation; (3) concurrent use of ASA, corticosteroids, and/or an anticoagulant; or (4) high dose/multiple NSAID (e.g., NSAID + low-dose ASA). Recent studies tend to show that H. Pylori does not act synergistically with NSAIDS to develop gastroduodenal lesions.<br />
		Recommendations<br />
		Patients with no risk factor and no cardiovascular disease: Non-selective NSAIDs OK (e.g, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.)<br />
		Patients at intermediate risk for gastrointestinal events and no cardiovascular disease:(1) A non-selective NSAID with either a PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor, for example, 20 mg omeprazole daily) or misoprostol (200 Âµg four times daily) or (2) a Cox-2 selective agent. Long-term PPI use (> 1 year) has been shown to increase the risk of hip fracture (adjusted odds ratio 1.44).<br />
		Patients at high risk for gastrointestinal events with no cardiovascular disease: A Cox-2 selective agent plus a PPI if absolutely necessary.<br />
		Patients at high risk of gastrointestinal events with cardiovascular disease: If GI risk is high the suggestion is for a low-dose Cox-2 plus low dose Aspirin (for cardioprotection) and a PPI. If cardiovascular risk is greater than GI risk the suggestion is naproxyn plus low-dose aspirin plus a PPI. (Laine, 2006) (Scholmerich, 2006) (Nielsen, 2006) (Chan, 2004) (Gold, 2007) (Laine, 2007)<br />
		Use of NSAIDs and SSRIs: The concurrent use of SSRIs and NSAIDs is associated with moderate excess relative risk of serious upper GI events when compared to NSAIDs alone. This risk was higher for non-selective NSAIDs when compared to Cox-2 selective agents (adjusted odds ratio of 1.77 and 1.33, respectively). (Helin-Salmivaara, 2007)<br />
		Treatment of dyspepsia secondary to NSAID therapy: Stop the NSAID, switch to a different NSAID, or consider H2-receptor antagonists or a PPI.<br />
