		&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br />
		Bupropion (Wellbutrin)<br />
		Recommended as an option after other agents. While bupropion has shown some efficacy in neuropathic pain there is no evidence of efficacy in patients with non-neuropathic chronic low back pain. Furthermore, bupropion is generally a third-line medication for diabetic neuropathy and may be considered when patients have not had a response to a tricyclic or SNRI. See Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Bupropion listing for more information and references.<br />
		Antidepressants for chronic pain<br />
		Recommended as a first line option for neuropathic pain, and as a possibility for non-neuropathic pain. (Feuerstein, 1997) (Perrot, 2006) Tricyclics are generally considered a first-line agent unless they are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated. Analgesia generally occurs within a few days to a week, whereas antidepressant effect takes longer to occur. (Saarto-Cochrane, 2005)<br />
		SPECIFIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS:<br />
		Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):<br />
		Bupropion (Wellbutrin), a second-generation non-tricyclic antidepressant (a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor) has been shown to be effective in relieving neuropathic pain of different etiologies in a small trial (41 patients). (Finnerup, 2005) While bupropion has shown some efficacy in neuropathic pain there is no evidence of efficacy in patients with non-neuropathic chronic low back pain. (Katz, 2005) Furthermore, a recent review suggested that bupropion is generally a third-line medication for diabetic neuropathy and may be considered when patients have not had a response to a tricyclic or SNRI. (Dworkin, 2007)<br />
		Side-effect profile: Headache, agitation, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss<br />
		Dosing Information: Neuropathic pain (off-label indication): 100 mg once daily, increase by 100 mg per week up to 200 mg twice daily. (Maizels, 2005)<br />
		Dosing: Neuropathic pain (off-label indication): 37.5 mg once daily, increase by 37.5 mg per week up to 300 mg daily. (Maizels, 2005) (ICSI, 2007) Trial period: Some relief may occur in first two weeks; full benefit may not occur until six weeks. Withdrawal effects can be severe. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided and tapering is recommended before discontinuation.<br />
