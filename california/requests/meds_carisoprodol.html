		Carisoprodol (Soma)<br />
		Not recommended. This medication is not indicated for long-term use. Carisoprodol is a commonly prescribed, centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant whose primary active metabolite is meprobamate (a schedule-IV controlled substance). Carisoprodol is now scheduled in several states but not on a federal level. It has been suggested that the main effect is due to generalized sedation and treatment of anxiety. Abuse has been noted for sedative and relaxant effects. In regular abusers the main concern is the accumulation of meprobamate. Carisoprodol abuse has also been noted in order to augment or alter effects of other drugs. This includes the following: (1) increasing sedation of benzodiazepines or alcohol; (2) use to prevent side effects of cocaine; (3) use with tramadol to produce relaxation and euphoria; (4) as a combination with hydrocodone, an effect that some abusers claim is similar to heroin (referred to as a "Las Vegas Cocktail"); & (5) as a combination with codeine (referred to as "Soma Coma"). (Reeves, 1999) (Reeves, 2001) (Reeves, 2008) (Schears, 2004) There was a 300% increase in numbers of emergency room episodes related to carisoprodol from 1994 to 2005. (DHSS, 2005) Intoxication appears to include subdued consciousness, decreased cognitive function, and abnormalities of the eyes, vestibular function, appearance, gait and motor function. Intoxication includes the effects of both carisoprodol and meprobamate, both of which act on different neurotransmitters. (Bramness, 2007) (Bramness, 2004) A withdrawal syndrome has been documented that consists of insomnia, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, anxiety, and ataxia when abrupt discontinuation of large doses occurs. This is similar to withdrawal from meprobamate. (Reeves, 2007) (Reeves, 2004) There is little research in terms of weaning of high dose carisoprodol and there is no standard treatment regimen for patients with known dependence. Most treatment includes treatment for symptomatic complaints of withdrawal. Another option is to switch to phenobarbital to prevent withdrawal with subsequent tapering. A maximum dose of phenobarbital is 500 mg/day and the taper is 30 mg/day with a slower taper in an outpatient setting. Tapering should be individualized for each patient.

		Muscle relaxants (for pain)<br />
		ANTISPASMODICS: Used to decrease muscle spasm in conditions such as LBP although it appears that these medications are often used for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions whether spasm is present or not. The mechanism of action for most of these agents is not known. (Chou, 2004)<br />
		Carisoprodol (Soma, Soprodal 350, Vanadom, generic available): Neither of these formulations is recommended for longer than a 2 to 3 week period. Carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate an anixolytic that is a schedule IV controlled substance. Carisoprodol is classified as a schedule IV drug in several states but not on a federal level. It is suggested that its main effect is due to generalized sedation as well as treatment of anxiety. This drug was approved for marketing before the FDA required clinical studies to prove safety and efficacy. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with abrupt discontinuation. (See, 2008) (Reeves, 2003) For more details, see Carisoprodol, where it is "Not recommended." See also Weaning of medications.<br />
		Side Effects: drowsiness, psychological and physical dependence, & withdrawal with acute discontinuation.
		Dosing: 250 mg-350 mg four times a day. (See, 2008)<br />
