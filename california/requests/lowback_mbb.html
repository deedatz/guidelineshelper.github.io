	There is good quality medical literature demonstrating that radiofrequency neurotomy of facet joint nerves in the cervical spine provides good temporary relief of pain. Similar quality literature does not exist regarding the same procedure in the lumbar region. Lumbar facet neurotomies reportedly produce mixed results. Facet neurotomies should be performed only after appropriate investigation involving controlled differential dorsal ramus medial branch diagnostic blocks.
