		Duloxetine (Cymbalta)<br />
		Recommended as an option in first-line treatment option in neuropathic pain. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SNRIs). It has FDA approval for treatment of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and for the treatment of pain related to diabetic neuropathy, with effect found to be significant by the end of week 1 (effect measured as a 30% reduction in baseline pain). The starting dose is 20-60 mg/day, and no advantage has been found by increasing the dose to twice a day, except in fibromyalgia. The medication has been found to be effective for treating fibromyalgia in women with and without depression, 60 mg once or twice daily. (Arnold, 2005) The most frequent side effects include nausea, dizziness and fatigue. GI symptoms are more common early in treatment. The side effect profile of Duloxetine is thought to be less bothersome to patients than that of tricyclic antidepressants. Note: On October 17, 2005, Eli Lilly and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified healthcare professionals of revision to the PRECAUTIONS/ Hepatotoxicity section of the prescribing information for Cymbalta. Postmarketing reports of hepatic injury (including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice) suggest that patients with preexisting liver disease who take duloxetine may have an increased risk for further liver damage. The new labeling extends the Precaution against using Cymbalta in patients with substantial alcohol use to include those patients with chronic liver disease. It is recommended that Cymbalta not be administered to patients with hepatic insufficiency. See also Antidepressants for chronic pain for general guidelines, as well as specific Duloxetine listing for more information and references. On June 13, 2008, the FDA approved a new indication for duloxetine HCl delayed-release capsules (Cymbalta; Eli Lilly and Company) for the management of fibromyalgia in adults. The FDA notes that although duloxetine was effective for reducing pain in patients with and without major depressive disorder, the degree of pain relief may have been greater in those with comorbid depression. Treatment of fibromyalgia with duloxetine should be initiated at 30 mg/day for 1 week and then uptitrated to the recommended 60-mg dose. (Waknine, 2008) Note: This drug was recently included in a list of 20 medications identified by the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, that are under FDA investigation. (FDA, 2008)<br />

		Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):<br />
		Duloxetine (Cymbalta): FDA-approved for anxiety, depression, diabetic neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. Used off-label for neuropathic pain and radiculopathy. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line option for diabetic neuropathy. (Dworkin, 2007) No high quality evidence is reported to support the use of duloxetine for lumbar radiculopathy. (Dworkin, 2007) More studies are needed to determine the efficacy of duloxetine for other types of neuropathic pain.<br />
		Side effects: CNS: dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, drowsiness, anxiety (3% vs.2% for placebo), insomnia (8-13% vs. 6-7% for placebo). GI: nausea and vomiting (5-30%), weight loss (2%). Duloxetine can worsen diabetic control in some patients. It also causes sexual dysfunction. (Maizels, 2005)<br />
		Dosing: 60 mg once a day as an off-label option for chronic pain syndromes. Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with renal insufficiency.<br />
