Epidural steroid injections (ESIs)
<br />
Recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain (defined as pain in dermatomal distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy). See specific criteria for use below. Most current guidelines recommend no more than 2 ESI injections. This is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a &quot;series of three&quot; ESIs. These early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Research has now shown that, on average, less than two injections are required for a successful ESI outcome. Current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection, and a third ESI is rarely recommended. Epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts, including continuing a home exercise program. There is little information on improved function. The American Academy of Neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between 2 and 6 weeks following the injection, but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months, and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain. (Armon, 2007) See also Epidural steroid injections, &quot;series of three.&quot;
<br />
Criteria for the use of Epidural steroid injections:
<br />
Note: The purpose of ESI is to reduce pain and inflammation, restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs, and avoiding surgery, but this treatment alone offers no significant long-term functional benefit.
<br />
1) Radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and/or electrodiagnostic testing.
<br />
2) Initially unresponsive to conservative treatment (exercises, physical methods, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants).
<br />
3) Injections should be performed using fluoroscopy (live x-ray) for guidance.
<br />
4) If used for diagnostic purposes, a maximum of two injections should be performed. A second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block. Diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections.
<br />
5) No more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks.
<br />
6) No more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session.
<br />
7) In the therapeutic phase, repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement, including at least 50% pain relief with associated reduction of medication use for six to eight weeks, with a general recommendation of no more than 4 blocks per region per year. (Manchikanti, 2003) (CMS, 2004) (Boswell, 2007)
<br />
8) Current research does not support a &quot;series-of-three&quot; injections in either the diagnostic or therapeutic phase. We recommend no more than 2 ESI injections.
