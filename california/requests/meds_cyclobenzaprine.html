		Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)<br />
		Recommended as an option, using a short course of therapy. See Medications for chronic pain for other preferred options. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain; the effect is modest and comes at the price of greater adverse effects. The effect is greatest in the first 4 days of treatment, suggesting that shorter courses may be better. (Browning, 2001) Treatment should be brief. There is also a post-op use. The addition of cyclobenzaprine to other agents is not recommended. (Clinical Pharmacology, 2008) Cyclobenzaprine-treated patients with fibromyalgia were 3 times as likely to report overall improvement and to report moderate reductions in individual symptoms, particularly sleep. (Tofferi, 2004) Note: Cyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline. See Antidepressants. Cyclobenzaprine is associated with a number needed to treat of 3 at 2 weeks for symptom improvement in LBP and is associated with drowsiness and dizziness. (Kinkade, 2007) Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant and a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that is marketed as Flexeril by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical.<br />
		Muscle relaxants (for pain)<br /> 
		ANTISPASMODICS: Used to decrease muscle spasm in conditions such as LBP although it appears that these medications are often used for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions whether spasm is present or not. The mechanism of action for most of these agents is not known. (Chou, 2004)<br /> 
		Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril, Amrix, Fexmid, generic available): Recommended for a short course of therapy. Limited, mixed-evidence does not allow for a recommendation for chronic use. Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant and a central nervous system depressant with similar effects to tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline). Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain, although the effect is modest and comes at the price of adverse effects. It has a central mechanism of action, but it is not effective in treating spasticity from cerebral palsy or spinal cord disease. Cyclobenzaprine is associated with a number needed to treat of 3 at 2 weeks for symptom improvement. The greatest effect appears to be in the first 4 days of treatment. (Browning, 2001) (Kinkade, 2007) (Toth, 2004) See Cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine has been shown to produce a modest benefit in treatment of fibromyalgia. Cyclobenzaprine-treated patients with fibromyalgia were 3 times more likely to report overall improvement and to report moderate reductions in individual symptoms (particularly sleep). A meta-analysis concluded that the number needed to treat for patients with fibromyalgia was 4.8. (ICSI, 2007) (Tofferi, 2004)<br />
		Side Effects: Include anticholinergic effects (drowsiness, urinary retention and dry mouth). Sedative effects may limit use. Headache has been noted. This medication should be avoided in patients with arrhythmias, heart block, heart failure and recent myocardial infarction. Side effects limit use in the elderly. (See, 2008) (Toth, 2004)<br />
		Dosing: 5 mg three times a day. Can be increased to 10 mg three times a day. This medication is not recommended to be used for longer than 2-3 weeks. (See, 2008)<br />
