	    Chapter 8 - Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br /> 
	    </p>
	    <p>
General Approach and Basic Principles
<br>
Neck and upper back complaints that may be work related are common
problems presenting to occupational and primary care providers; such
complaints
are among the ten most common causes of reported occupational
complaints and workers’ compensation claims. These complaints account for
about 6-8% of total lost workdays in workers’ compensation and about 8% of
claims, ranking them in the top ten for financial severity as well.
<br>
Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with potentially workrelated
neck and upper back complaints are presented in this chapter. Topics
include the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients; identification of red
flags that may indicate the presence of a serious underlying medical condition;
initial management; diagnostic considerations and special studies for identifying
clinical pathology, work-relatedness, return to work, modified duty and
activity; and further management considerations, including the management
of delayed recovery.
<br>
Algorithms for patient management are included. This chapter’s master
algorithm schematizes the manner in which primary care and occupational
medicine practitioners generally can manage patients with acute and subacute
neck and upper back complaints. The following text, tables, and numbered
algorithms expand upon the master algorithm.
<br>
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with
neck and upper back complaints are as follows:
<br>
The initial assessment focuses on detecting indications of potentially
serious disease, termed red flags.
<br>
In the absence of red flags, imaging and other tests are not usually
helpful during the first four weeks of neck and upper back symptoms.
<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by nonprescription
medication.
<br>
Primary care or occupational physicians can effectively manage acute
and subacute neck and upper back problems conservatively in the
absence of red flags.
<br>
While some activity or job modification may be necessary in the acute
period, bed rest for more than two days is not helpful and may further
debilitate the patient.
<br>
Patients may engage in normal, preinjury activities to facilitate recovery
from non-red-flag acute neck disorders such as whiplash-associated
disorders(WAD), which is generally more effective than rest and immobilization.
<br>
Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started immediately as tolerated
to help avoid debilitation. Stretching exercises may be helpful to
avoid further restriction of motion. Exercises to strengthen neck, upper
back, and shoulder muscles are commonly delayed for several weeks.
<br>
Patients recovering from acute and subacute neck and upper back
problems should be encouraged to return to modified- or full-duty
work as soon as possible.
<br>
If symptoms persist (e.g., beyond four to six weeks), further evaluation
may be indicated.
<br>
Within the first three months of neck and upper back symptoms, the
only patients who can be expected to benefit from surgery are those
with evidence of severe spinovertebral disease (tumor, infection, major
trauma, or progressive neurologic deficit) or with severe, debilitating
symptoms and physiologic evidence of specific nerve root or spinal
cord compromise, corroborated by appropriate imaging studies.
<br>
Nonphysical factors (such as psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems) can be investigated and addressed in cases of delayed
recovery or return to work.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Assessment
<br>
Thorough medical and work histories and a focused physical examination
(see Chapter 2) are sufficient for initially assessing a patient complaining of
potentially work-related neck or upper back symptoms. Certain findings in
this assessment raise suspicion of serious underlying medical conditions; these
are referred to as red flags (see Table 8-1). Their absence rules out the need
for special studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first four weeks, during
which time spontaneous recovery is expected (provided any inciting workplace
factors are mitigated). Findings of the medical history and physical examination
also may alert the clinician to other pathology (not of neck or upper back
origin) that can present as neck or upper back complaints. Neck and upper
back complaints can then be classified into one of three working categories
although common factors may be operative in all three, thus confounding
this classification:
<br>
Potentially serious neck or upper back disorders: fracture, dislocation,
infection, tumor, progressive neurologic deficit, or cord compression
<br>
Degenerative disorders: consequences of aging or repetitive use, or a
combination thereof, such as degenerative disk disease and osteoarthritis
<br>
Nonspecific disorders: including benign, self-limited disorders with
unclear etiology, such as regional upper back and neck pain and shoulder
pain adjacent to the neck
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Medical History<br>
Asking the patient open-ended questions, such as those listed below, allows
the clinician to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries to
obtain more detailed information (see also Chapter 2):<br>
1. WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?<br>
Do you have pain, numbness, weakness, or stiffness?<br>
For traumatic injuries:Was the area deformed? Did you lose any blood
or have an open wound?<br>
Is the discomfort located primarily in your neck, upper back, or shoulder?
Do you have pain or other symptoms elsewhere?<br>
Are your symptoms constant or intermittent? What makes the problem
worse or better?<br>
2. HOW DO THESE SYMPTOMS LIMIT YOU?<br>
How long can you sit, stand, walk, do overhead work?<br>
Can you lift? How much weight?<br>
When did your current limitations begin? Was there a specific inciting
event?<br>
How did the limitations develop?<br>
How long have your activities been limited? More than four weeks?<br>
Have your symptoms changed? How?<br>
Have you had similar episodes previously?<br>
Have you had previous testing or treatment? With whom?<br>
What do you think caused the problem? How do you think it is related
to work?<br>
What are your specific job duties? Do you use your neck and upper
back to perform them? How? How often?<br>
What other activities (hobbies, workouts, sports) do you engage in at
home or elsewhere? Do you use your neck and upper back to perform
them? How? How often?<br>
Are your symptoms affected by activities of daily living, such as grooming
(combing your hair) or driving?<br>
Do you have other medical problems?<br>
What do you hope we can accomplish during this visit?<br>
Determining the presence of cervical nerve root compromise (and, if so, the
level of compromise) is critical. Pain or paresthesia, combined with muscle
weakness, sensory deficits, and reflex loss suggests cervical nerve root compression.
Clinical findings correlating with specific dermatomal levels of compression
are shown in Table 8-2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Physical Examination<br>
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination includes:<br>
General observation of the patient, including stance and gait<br>
Regional examination of neck, proximal shoulder area, and upper
back<br>
Neurologic screening<br>
Testing for cervical nerve root irritation<br>
The objective parts of the examination are testing reflexes and circumferential
measurements of the upper extremity for atrophy. All other findings require
the patient’s cooperation. If spasm is present, it is an objective finding, not
simply an inferred manifestation of guarding by the patient.<br>
A patient who has a neck or upper back disorder may present with a
complaint of shoulder pain; he or she may point to the top of the shoulder
or to the upper trapezius area, between the base of the neck and the point
of the shoulder. This type of pain is most commonly related to the neck, and
evaluation includes inspecting the neck and upper back, as noted in this
guideline. Interscapular or scapular pain also is a common manifestation of neck
abnormalities. Careful physical examination of the cervical area is indicated for
patients with either shoulder or interscapular/scapular pain.<br>
<br>
<br>

Motor Weakness: Finger abduction, adduction<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Observation and Regional Neck Examination<br>
Observing the patient’s stance and gait is useful to guide the remainder of
the examination. Uncoordination or abnormal use of the extremities may
indicate the need for specific neurologic testing. Severe guarding of cervical
motion in all planes may add credence to a suspected diagnosis of spinal or
intrathecal infection, tumor, or fracture. However, because of the marked
variation among persons with and without symptoms, range-of-motion measurements
of the neck and upper back are of limited value except as a means
to monitor recovery in cases of restriction of motion due to symptoms.<br>
Vertebral-point tenderness to palpation, when associated with other signs
or symptoms, is suggestive of, but not specific for, spinal fracture or infection.
Palpable soft-tissue tenderness alone is an even less specific or reliable
finding.<br>
<br>
Neurologic Screening<br>
The neurologic examination should focus on a few tests that reveal evidence
of nerve root impairment, peripheral neuropathy, or spinal cord dysfunction.
Most herniated disks in the cervical spine involve the C5-6 or the C6-7 levels
and the C6 or C7 nerve roots, respectively. The C5 and C8 roots are less
commonly involved. Table 8-3 summarizes the clinical features of cervical
nerve root compression.<br>
<br>
1. TESTING FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH<br>
Nerve root compromise at the C5 level (C4-5 disk) can cause weakness of
shoulder abduction as well as elbow flexion or supination. Compromise at
the C6 level (C5-6 disk) can produce weakness of radial wrist extension. The
C7 nerve root (C6-7 disk) innervates the triceps muscle; weakness of elbow
extension and of ulnar wrist flexion indicates compromise at this level. Weak
finger extension is a sign of C7 nerve root compromise as well. C8 (C7-8
disk) involvement is indicated by weakness of finger abduction and adduction,
as the lumbrical muscles of the hand are affected.<br>
2. CIRCUMFERENTIAL MEASUREMENTS<br>
Muscle atrophy can be detected by bilateral circumferential measurements of
the upper arms and forearms. The dominant upper extremity usually will have
an increase of 1/4 inch in circumference at the forearm and, possibly, also at
the upper arm.<br>
3. REFLEXES<br>
The biceps reflex primarily tests the C5 root, and, to a lesser extent, the C6
root. The brachioradialis reflex tests the C6 root; the triceps reflex, the C7
root. The Hoffmann reflex in combination with clonus may indicate an upper
motor neuron lesion.<br>
4. SENSORY EXAMINATION<br>
Testing light touch, pressure, and pinprick sensations in the forearm and hand
is usually sufficient to detect common nerve root compromise, but sensory
examination of the area from the neck to the forearm may be necessary to
test for higher nerve root compromise. Decreased sensation over the lateral
deltoid muscle is a sign of C5 nerve root or axillary nerve compromise. Loss
of sensation in the area of the lateral thumb, index finger, and medial half of
the middle finger indicates C6 nerve root involvement. Decreased sensation
in the long (middle) finger may be a sign of C7 involvement, although it also
is supplied occasionally by the C6 or C8 nerve root. The C8 root may show
ring- and fifth-finger sensory findings; the ulnar side of the small (fifth) finger
is the purest area of C8 innervation. The T1 nerve root can be tested by
evaluating sensation in the upper medial forearm and medial arm.<br>

Assessing Red Flags and Indications
for Immediate Referral<br>
Physical examination evidence of severe neurologic compromise that correlates
with the medical history and test results may indicate a need for immediate
consultation. The examination may further reinforce or reduce suspicions of
tumor, infection, fracture, or dislocation. A medical history suggestive of
pathology originating somewhere other than in the cervical area may warrant
examination of the head, shoulder, or other areas.<br>
Cervical nerve root irritation can be demonstrated by depressing the clavicle
or deeply palpating the posterior triangle of the neck. This maneuver
should reproduce the patient’s symptoms and signs if the cervical nerves are
the source of neurologic symptoms and signs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diagnostic Criteria<br>
If the patient does not have red flags for serious conditions, the clinician
can then determine which common musculoskeletal disorder is present. The
criteria presented in Table 8-4 follow the clinical thought process, from the
mechanism of illness or injury to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder, and finally to test results if any tests are needed to guide treatment
at this stage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Table 8-4. Diagnostic Criteria for Non-red-flag Conditions that Can Be Managed by Primary
Care Physicians<br>

<br>
<br>
Work Relatedness<br>
A thorough work history is crucial to establishing work-relatedness. See Chapter
2 for components of the work history.<br>
Because neck and upper back complaints may be related to workstation
factors, an accurate history of work- and non-work-related activities is imperative.
Questioning about ergonomic positioning, use of a headset, computer
screen placement, and many other factors is important. Reviews of epidemiologic
studies have shown neck tension symptoms to be related to repetitive
work and constrained postures. The work relatedness of the other neck and
upper back conditions is not well delineated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Care<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s first concern. Nonprescription analgesics will
provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute symptoms.
If treatment response is inadequate (i.e., if symptoms and activity limitations
continue), prescribed pharmaceuticals or physical methods can be added.
Comorbid conditions, side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences
generally guide the clinician’s choice of recommendations. Table 8-5 summarizes
comfort options.<br>
<br>
Manipulation has been compared to various treatments, but not placebo
or nontreatment, for patients with neck pain in nearly twenty
randomized clinical trials. More than half favored manipulation, with
one reporting better results in combination with exercise, while the
remainder indicated treatments were equivocal. Cervical manipulation
has not yet been studied in workers’ compensation populations.<br>
In rare instances (estimated at 1.0-1.5 per million manipulations),
manipulation has been associated with cerebrovascular accident. Some
studies suggest that this risk is based on the position of the patient,
not the act of manipulation itself. Serious side effects are extremely rare
and far less frequent than those associated with commonly prescribed
alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
but the issue is currently under study and should be monitored.<br>
Using cervical manipulation may be an option for patients with
occupationally related neck pain or cervicogenic headache. Consistent
with application of any passive manual approach in injury care, it is
reasonable to incorporate it within the context of functional restoration
rather than for pain control alone. There is insufficient evidence to
support manipulation of patients with cervical radiculopathy.<br>
<br>
There is no high-grade scientific evidence to support the effectiveness
or ineffectiveness of passive physical modalities such as traction, heat/
cold applications, massage, diathermy, cutaneous laser treatment, ultrasound,
transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS) units, and
biofeedback. These palliative tools may be used on a trial basis but
should be monitored closely. Emphasis should focus on functional
restoration and return of patients to activities of normal daily living.<br>
<br>
There is limited evidence that electromagnetic therapy may be effective
to reduce pain in mechanical neck disorders. If used, there should be
a trial period with objective signs of functional progress.<br>
<br>
Invasive techniques (e.g., needle acupuncture and injection procedures,
such as injection of trigger points, facet joints, or corticosteroids, lidocaine, or opioids in the epidural space) have no proven
benefit in treating acute neck and upper back symptoms. However,
many pain physicians believe that diagnostic and/or therapeutic injections
may help patients presenting in the transitional phase between
acute and chronic pain.<br>
<br>
Injecting botulinum toxin (type A and B) has been shown to be
effective in reducing pain and improving range of motion (ROM) in
cervical dystonia (a disorder that is non-traumatic and non-workrelated).
Mild side effects were fairly common and dose dependent,
including dry mouth and dysphagia. While existing evidence shows
injecting botulinum toxin to be safe, caution is needed due to the
scarcity of high-quality studies. There are no high quality studies that
support its use in whiplash-associated disorder.<br>
<br>
Cervical epidural corticosteroid injections are of uncertain benefit and
should be reserved for patients who otherwise would undergo open
surgical procedures for nerve root compromise.<br>
<br>
Other miscellaneous therapies have been evaluated and found to be
ineffective or minimally effective. For example, cervical collars have
not been shown to have any lasting benefit, except for comfort in the
first few days of the clinical course in severe cases; in fact, weakness
may result from prolonged use and will contribute to debilitation.
Immobilization using collars and prolonged periods of rest are generally
less effective than having patients maintain their usual, ‘‘preinjury’’
activities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Table 8-5. Methods of Symptom Control for Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br>
RECOMMENDED<br>
Nonprescription Medications: Acetaminophen (safest), NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)<br>
Physical Modalities: Adjustment or modification of workstation, job tasks, or work hours and methods, Stretching, Specific neck exercises for range of motion and strengthening, At-home local applications of cold packs during first few days of acute complaints; thereafter, applications of heat packs, Relaxation techniques, Aerobic exercise, 1-2 physical therapy visits for education, counseling, and evaluation of home exercise<br>
Prescribed Pharmaceutical Methods: Other NSAIDs<br>
OPTIONS<br>
Cervical Disk Displacement with Radiculopathy: Short-term immobilization of the cervical spine if severe<br>
Cervical Strain: Brief immobilization of the cervical spine if severe<br>
Central Cord Compression: Collar or brace for stabilization until emergent surgery performed<br>
Spinal Stenosis: Brief immobilization of the cervical spine if severe<br>
Postlaminectomy Syndrome: Immobilization of the cervical spine if severe<br>
Regional Neck Symptoms: Brief immobilization of the cervical spine if severe<br>
<br>
<br>
Activity Alteration<br>
To avoid neck or upper back irritation and debilitation due to inactivity,
recommendations for alternative activity can be helpful. As a general principle,
acutely avoid activities that precipitate symptoms, but general activities and
motion may be continued. Therapeutic exercise, including strengthening,
should start as soon as it can be done without aggravating symptoms. Most
patients with neck pain do not require bed rest. The most severe cases of neck
pain (primarily those with arm pain) may be treated with one to two days of
bed rest. Prolonged bed rest (more than two days) has potential debilitating
effects, and its efficacy in treating acute neck pain is unproved.<br>
Activities causing an increase in stress on the neck tend to increase neck
symptoms. These activities can be reviewed with the patient and modifications
advised. Activities and postures that increase stress on the neck (e.g., driving,
workstation position, telephone use, repetitive motions, and other activities)
may require modification. Patients who work with video-display terminals
should be sure the keyboard and monitor are at a comfortable height and
angle because misadjustment of terminals as well as awkward use of laptop
computers are common causes of neck symptoms. Sitting posture and support
are important as well. For example, cradling a telephone receiver on the
shoulder can cause neck symptoms and indicates the need for a headset.
Frequent changes in position become important in many cases of neck and
upper back problems. Work activities involving crouching, stooping, working
under automobiles or dashboards, working in confined spaces, and the like
may require modification to maximize the patient’s activities and allow early
return to work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Activities<br>
Table 8-6 provides recommendations on activity modification and duration of
absence fromwork. Intended for patients without comorbidity or complicating
factors, including employment or legal issues, these guidelines are targets
providing a guide from the perspective of physiologic recovery. Key factors
to consider in disability duration are age and type of job, especially if the
regular work includes activities likely to worsen the condition. The clinician
can make clear to patients and employers that:<br>
Even moderately heavy lifting, carrying, or working in awkward positions
may aggravate neck symptoms from cervical strain, cervical nerve
root irritation, etc.<br>
Any restrictions are intended to allow for spontaneous recovery or for
time to build activity tolerance through exercise.<br>
Measures to assist the patient in avoiding aggravating activities include
reviewing work duties to decide whether modifications can be accomplished
and to determine whether modified duty is available. Make every attempt to
maintain the patient at maximal levels of activity, including work activities.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Follow-up Visits<br>
Patients whose neck or upper back complaints may be work related should
receive follow-up care every three to five days by a midlevel practitioner, who
can counsel them about avoiding static positions, medication use, activity
modification, and other concerns. Take care to answer questions and make
these sessions interactive so that patients are fully involved in their recovery.
If the patient has returned to work, these interactions may be done on site
or by telephone to avoid interfering with modified- or full-work activities.<br>
Physician follow-up generally occurs when a release to modified, increased,
or full duty is needed, or after appreciable healing or recovery can be expected,
on average. Physician follow-up might be expected every four to seven days
if the patient is off work and every seven to fourteen days if the patient is
working.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
For most patients presenting with true neck or upper back problems, special
studies are not needed unless a three- or four-week period of conservative
care and observation fails to improve symptoms. Most patients improve quickly,
provided any red-flag conditions are ruled out.<br>
Criteria for ordering imaging studies are:<br>
Emergence of a red flag<br>
Physiologic evidence of tissue insult or neurologic dysfunction<br>
Failure to progress in a strengthening program intended to avoid
surgery<br>
Clarification of the anatomy prior to an invasive procedure<br>
<br>
Physiologic evidence may be in the form of definitive neurologic findings on
physical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, laboratory tests, or bone scans.
Unequivocal findings that identify specific nerve compromise on the neurologic
examination are sufficient evidence to warrant imaging studies if symptoms
persist. When the neurologic examination is less clear, however, further
physiologic evidence of nerve dysfunction can be obtained before ordering
an imaging study. Electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction velocities
(NCV), including H-reflex tests, may help identify subtle focal neurologic
dysfunction in patients with neck or arm symptoms, or both, lasting more
than three or four weeks. The assessment may include sensory-evoked potentials
(SEPs) if spinal stenosis or spinal cord myelopathy is suspected. If physiologic
evidence indicates tissue insult or nerve impairment, consider a discussion
with a consultant regarding next steps, including the selection of an imaging
test to define a potential cause (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] for neural
or other soft tissue, compute tomography [CT] for bony structures). Additional
studies may be considered to further define problem areas. The recent
evidence indicates cervical disk annular tears may be missed on MRIs. The
clinical significance of such a finding is unclear, as it may not correlate temporally
or anatomically with symptoms.<br>
Diskography is frequently used prior to cervical fusions and certain diskrelated
procedures. There is significant scientific evidence that questions the
usefulness of diskography in those settings. While recent studies indicate diskography
to be relatively safe and have a low complication rate, some studies
suggest the opposite to be true. In any case, clear evidence is lacking to support
its efficacy over other imaging procedures in identifying the location of cervical
symptoms, and, therefore, directing intervention appropriately. Tears may not
correlate anatomically or temporally with symptoms. Because this area is rapidly
evolving, clinicians should consult the latest available studies.<br>
Table 8-7 provides a general comparison of the abilities of different techniques
to identify physiologic insult and define anatomic defects. In the following
circumstances, an imaging study may be appropriate for a patient whose
limitations due to consistent symptoms have persisted for four to six weeks
or more:<br>
When surgery is being considered for a specific anatomic defect<br>
To further evaluate the possibility of potentially serious pathology,
such as a tumor<br>
Reliance on imaging studies alone to evaluate the source of neck or upper
back symptoms carries a significant risk of diagnostic confusion (false-positive
test results) because it’s possible to identify a finding that was present before
symptoms began and, therefore, has no temporal association with the symptoms.<br>

Surgical Considerations<br>
Within the first three months of onset of potentially work-related acute neck
and upper back symptoms, consider surgery only if the following are detected:<br>
Severe spinovertebral pathology<br>
Severe, debilitating symptoms with physiologic evidence of specific
nerve root or spinal cord dysfunction corroborated on appropriate
imaging studies that did not respond to conservative therapy<br>
<br>
A disk herniation, characterized by protrusion of the central nucleus pulposus
through a defect in the outer annulus fibrosis, may impinge on a nerve
root, causing irritation, shoulder and arm symptoms, and nerve root dysfunction. The presence of a herniated cervical or upper thoracic disk on an imaging
study, however, does not necessarily imply nerve root dysfunction. Studies of
asymptomatic adults commonly demonstrate intervertebral disk herniations
that apparently do not cause symptoms.<br>
Referral for surgical consultation is indicated for patients who have:<br>
Persistent, severe, and disabling shoulder or arm symptoms<br>
Activity limitation for more than one month or with extreme progression
of symptoms<br>
Clear clinical, imaging, and electrophysiologic evidence, consistently
indicating the same lesion that has been shown to benefit from surgical
repair in both the short- and long-term<br>
Unresolved radicular symptoms after receiving conservative treatment<br>
<br>
The efficacy of cervical fusion for patients with chronic cervical pain without
instability has not been demonstrated. If surgery is a consideration, counseling
and discussion regarding likely outcomes, risks and benefits, and especially
expectations is essential. Patients with acute neck or upper back pain alone,
without findings of serious conditions or significant nerve root compromise,
rarely benefit from either surgical consultation or surgery. If there is no clear
indication for surgery, referring the patient to a physical medicine and rehab
(PM&R) specialist may help resolve symptoms. Based on extrapolating studies
on low back pain, it also would be prudent to consider a psychological evaluation
of the patient prior to referral for surgery.<br>
Many patients with strong clinical findings of nerve root dysfunction due
to disk herniation recover activity tolerance within one month; there is no
evidence that delaying surgery for this period worsens outcomes in patients
without progressive neurologic findings. Spontaneous improvement in MRIdocumented
cervical disk pathology has been demonstrated with a high rate
of resolution. Surgery increases the likelihood that patients will have to have
future procedures with higher complication rates. A 12% reoperation rate was
reported in one large series. Patients with comorbid conditions, such as cardiac
or respiratory disease, diabetes, or mental illness, may be poor candidates for
surgery. Comorbidity can be judged and discussed carefully with the patient.<br>
<br>
A. Cervical Nerve Root Decompression<br>
Cervical nerve root decompression may be accomplished in one of two major
ways. Some practitioners prefer cervical laminectomy and disk excision with
nerve root decompression, especially for posterolateral or lateral disk ruptures
or foraminal osteophytes. However, anterior disk excision is performed more
often, especially for central herniations or osteophytes. Possible complications
of decompression include wound infections, diskitis, recurrent disk material
or graft slippage (requiring return to surgery either immediately or subacutely),
and cervical cord damage. Thoroughly discussing the risks, benefits, and realistic expectations of surgery with the patient is warranted. For instance, in one
study, patients with radiation of pain to the arm(s) and hand(s) had better
relief of pain with surgery than those with neck pain alone. Pre-surgical screening
should include consideration of psychological evaluation.<br>
<br>
B. Other Procedures
Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain is less efficacious and has rare but serious
complications. Percutaneous diskectomy is not recommended because the
effectiveness of this procedure has not been demonstrated.
