						American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2nd Edition<br>
						Chapter 8 &ndash; Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br>
						Table 8&ndash;8 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure: Surgical considerations<br>
						Recommended: Careful preoperative education of the patient regarding expectations, complications, and short-term sequelae of surgery (D), Indications clear of failed conservative treatment and history, exam, and imaging consistent for specific lesion (D)<br>
						Not Recommended:  Discectomy or fusion without conservative treatment 4 to 6 weeks minimum (D)
						Discectomy or fusion for nonradiating pain or in absence of evidence of nerve root compromise (D)<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Within the first three months of onset of potentially work-related acute neck
						and upper back symptoms, consider surgery only if the following are detected:<br>
						Severe spinovertebral pathology<br>
						Severe, debilitating symptoms with physiologic evidence of specific
						nerve root or spinal cord dysfunction corroborated on appropriate
						imaging studies that did not respond to conservative therapy<br>
						<br>
						A disk herniation, characterized by protrusion of the central nucleus pulposus
						through a defect in the outer annulus fibrosis, may impinge on a nerve
						root, causing irritation, shoulder and arm symptoms, and nerve root dysfunction. The presence of a herniated cervical or upper thoracic disk on an imaging
						study, however, does not necessarily imply nerve root dysfunction. Studies of
						asymptomatic adults commonly demonstrate intervertebral disk herniations
						that apparently do not cause symptoms.<br>
						Referral for surgical consultation is indicated for patients who have:<br>
						Persistent, severe, and disabling shoulder or arm symptoms<br>
						Activity limitation for more than one month or with extreme progression
						of symptoms<br>
						Clear clinical, imaging, and electrophysiologic evidence, consistently
						indicating the same lesion that has been shown to benefit from surgical
						repair in both the short- and long-term<br>
						Unresolved radicular symptoms after receiving conservative treatment<br>
						<br>
						The efficacy of cervical fusion for patients with chronic cervical pain without
						instability has not been demonstrated. If surgery is a consideration, counseling
						and discussion regarding likely outcomes, risks and benefits, and especially
						expectations is essential. Patients with acute neck or upper back pain alone,
						without findings of serious conditions or significant nerve root compromise,
						rarely benefit from either surgical consultation or surgery. If there is no clear
						indication for surgery, referring the patient to a physical medicine and rehab
						(PM&R) specialist may help resolve symptoms. Based on extrapolating studies
						on low back pain, it also would be prudent to consider a psychological evaluation
						of the patient prior to referral for surgery.<br>
						Many patients with strong clinical findings of nerve root dysfunction due
						to disk herniation recover activity tolerance within one month; there is no
						evidence that delaying surgery for this period worsens outcomes in patients
						without progressive neurologic findings. Spontaneous improvement in MRIdocumented
						cervical disk pathology has been demonstrated with a high rate
						of resolution. Surgery increases the likelihood that patients will have to have
						future procedures with higher complication rates. A 12% reoperation rate was
						reported in one large series. Patients with comorbid conditions, such as cardiac
						or respiratory disease, diabetes, or mental illness, may be poor candidates for
						surgery. Comorbidity can be judged and discussed carefully with the patient.<br>
						<br>
						A. Cervical Nerve Root Decompression<br>
						Cervical nerve root decompression may be accomplished in one of two major
						ways. Some practitioners prefer cervical laminectomy and disk excision with
						nerve root decompression, especially for posterolateral or lateral disk ruptures
						or foraminal osteophytes. However, anterior disk excision is performed more
						often, especially for central herniations or osteophytes. Possible complications
						of decompression include wound infections, diskitis, recurrent disk material
						or graft slippage (requiring return to surgery either immediately or subacutely),
						and cervical cord damage. Thoroughly discussing the risks, benefits, and realistic expectations of surgery with the patient is warranted. For instance, in one
						study, patients with radiation of pain to the arm(s) and hand(s) had better
						relief of pain with surgery than those with neck pain alone. Pre-surgical screening
						should include consideration of psychological evaluation.<br>
						<br>
						B. Other Procedures
						Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain is less efficacious and has rare but serious
						complications. Percutaneous diskectomy is not recommended because the
						effectiveness of this procedure has not been demonstrated.

						Chapter 9 &ndash; Shoulder Complaints<br>
						Table 9-6 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Shoulder Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure:  Surgical considerations<br>
						Recommended:  Anterior repair for recurrent dislocation after 2 to 3 dislocations (D), Resection of outer clavicle for chronic disabling AC joint pain after conservative care of acute separation (C), Rotator cuff repair after firm diagnosis is made and rehabilitation efforts have failed (D), Capsular shift surgery for disabling instability (D), Subacromial decompression after failure of non-operative care (C)<br>
						Not Recommended:  Anterior repair for initial shoulder dislocation (C), Acute repair of AC separation (C), Acute repair of rotator cuff tears, except for massive acute tears (C), Surgery for recurrent dislocation of instability before rehabilitation efforts (C)<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Referral for surgical consultation may be indicated for patients who have:<br>
						Red-flag conditions (e.g., acute rotator cuff tear in a young worker,
						glenohumeral joint dislocation, etc.)<br>
						Activity limitation for more than four months, plus existence of a
						surgical lesion<br>
						Failure to increase ROM and strength of the musculature around the
						shoulder even after exercise programs, plus existence of a surgical lesion<br>
						Clear clinical and imaging evidence of a lesion that has been shown
						to benefit, in both the short and long term, from surgical repair<br>
						<br>
						Surgical considerations depend on the working or imaging-confirmed diagnosis
						of the presenting shoulder complaint. If surgery is a consideration,
						counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks and benefits, and expectations, in
						particular, is very important. If there is no clear indication for surgery, referring
						the patient to a physical medicine practitioner may help resolve the symptoms.<br>
						For postsurgical rehabilitation, key indicators for further assessment and
						treatment include:<br>
						Prolonged course<br>
						Multiple surgical procedures<br>
						Use of narcotic medications<br>
						<br>
						A. Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Separation<br>
						Patients with AC joint separation may be treated conservatively. The expected
						period of pain is three weeks, with the pain gradually decreasing. If pain
						persists after recovery and return to activities, resection of the outer clavicle
						may be indicated after six months to one year, although local cortisone injections
						can be tried. The initial deformity decreases as healing and scar contracture
						take place. In one series, 79% of patients with moderate-to-severe
						AC separations had good-to-excellent late results with nonoperative treatment,
						and of the remainder, 90% had good-to-excellent results with simple excision
						of the outer clavicle.<br>
						<br>
						B. Rotator Cuff Tear<br>
						Rotator cuff repair is indicated for significant tears that impair activities by
						causing weakness of arm elevation or rotation, particularly acutely in younger
						workers. Rotator cuff tears are frequently partial-thickness or smaller fullthickness
						tears. For partial-thickness rotator cuff tears and small full-thickness
						tears presenting primarily as impingement, surgery is reserved for cases failing
						conservative therapy for three months. The preferred procedure is usually
						arthroscopic decompression, which involves debridement of inflamed tissue,
						burring of the anterior acromion, lysis and, sometimes, removal of the coracoacromial
						ligament, and possibly removal of the outer clavicle. Surgery is not
						indicated for patients with mild symptoms or those whose activities are not
						limited.<br>
						Lesions of the rotator cuff are a continuum, from mild supraspinatus
						tendon degeneration to complete ruptures. Studies of normal subjects document
						the universal presence of degenerative changes and conditions, including
						full avulsions without symptoms. Conservative treatment has results similar
						to surgical treatment but without surgical risks. Studies evaluating results of
						conservative treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears have shown an 82-
						86% success rate for patients presenting within three months of injury. The
						efficacy of arthroscopic decompression for full-thickness tears depends on the size of the tear; one study reported satisfactory results in 90% of patients with
						small tears. A prior study by the same group reported satisfactory results in
						86% of patients who underwent open repair for larger tears. Surgical outcomes
						of rotator cuff tears are much better in younger patients than in older patients
						who may be suffering from degenerative changes in the rotator cuff.<br>
						<br>
						C. Shoulder Dislocation<br>
						Multiple traumatic shoulder dislocations indicate the need for surgery if the
						shoulder has limited functional ability and if muscle strengthening fails. In
						the acute phase, shoulder dislocations can be immobilized for up to three
						weeks although recommendations for immobilization for a period as short as
						three days have appeared in the literature. If shoulder instability is present only
						with violent forceful overhead activity, activity modification is recommended.
						Surgery can be considered for patients who are symptomatic with all overhead
						activities and patients who have had two or three episodes of dislocation and
						instability that limited their activity between episodes. Rates of instability
						recurrence after surgery have been reported as 8% after open repair for anterior
						instability and 10% after arthroscopic anterior repair. A high incidence of
						rotator cuff tears accompanying anterior shoulder dislocations occurs in patients
						40 years old or older. Although the dislocation recurrence rate is very
						low, persistent weakness several weeks after a primary dislocation dictates
						further study to define the anatomy of the rotator cuff.<br>
						<br>
						D. Impingement Syndrome<br>
						Surgery for impingement syndrome is usually arthroscopic decompression.
						This procedure is not indicated for patients with mild symptoms or those who
						have no activity limitations. Conservative care, including cortisone injections,
						can be carried out for at least three to six months before considering surgery.
						Because this diagnosis is on a continuum with other rotator cuff conditions,
						including rotator cuff syndrome and rotator cuff tendinitis, also refer to the
						previous discussion of rotator cuff tears.<br>
						<br>
						E. Ruptured Biceps Tendon<br>
						Ruptures of the proximal (long head) of the biceps tendon are usually due
						to degenerative changes in the tendon. It can almost always be managed
						conservatively because there is no accompanying functional disability. Surgery
						may be desired for cosmetic reasons, especially by young bodybuilders, but
						is not necessary for function.<br>
						<br>
						F. Thoracic Outlet Compression Syndrome<br>
						Most patients with acute thoracic outlet compression symptoms will respond
						to a conservative program of global shoulder strengthening (with specific
						exercises) and ergonomic changes. While not well supported by high-grade
						scientific studies, cases with progressive weakness, atrophy, and neurologic
						dysfunction are sometimes considered for surgical decompression. A confirmatory
						response to electromyography (EMG)-guided scalene block, confirmatory
						electrophysiologic testing and/or magnetic resonance angiography with flow
						studies is advisable before considering surgery.<br>

                    	SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS<br>
	                    The timing of a referral for surgery should be consistent with the condition that has been diagnosed, the degree of functional impairment, and the progression and severity of objective findings. Conditions that
	                    produce objective evidence of nerve entrapment and that do not respond to non-surgical treatment can be
	                    considered for surgery when treatment failure has been documented, in spite of compliance with treatment.
	                    Conditions of inflammatory nature may take many months to heal and the timing of a surgical consultation
	                    referral should take into consideration the normal healing time. Referral for surgical consultation may be
	                    indicated for patients who have:<br>
	                    Significant limitations of activity for more than 3 months;<br>
	                    Failed to improve with exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength of the
	                    musculature around the elbow; or<br>
	                    Clear clinical and electrophysiologic or imaging evidence of a lesion that has been shown to benefit
	                    in both the short and long term from surgical repair.<br>
	                    <br>
	                    Emergency consultation is reserved for patients who require drainage or aspiration of acute septic effusions,
	                    ruptures (e.g., biceps), infected hematomas and/or drainage of infected bursitis, or who have severe acute
	                    nerve impingement.<br>
	                    Surgery during the first 3 months is only rarely indicated for elbow disorders that present for initial treatment.
	                    If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks, and benefits, and especially
	                    expectations is very important. It is also important to set pre-operative expectations that there is a necessity
	                    to adhere to the rehabilitative exercise regimen and work through post-operative pain. In the post-operative
	                    phase, range-of-motion exercises should involve the elbow, as well as the wrist and shoulder to avoid frozen
	                    shoulder (“adhesive capsulitis”).<br>
	                    <br>
	                    A. SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR LATERAL EPICONDYLALGIA<br>
	                    There is currently a debate regarding whether lateral epicondylalgia is an inflammatory condition or an
	                    enthesopathy and what treatments are most appropriate. Conservative care should be maintained for a
	                    minimum of 3–6 months. Although some individuals will improve with surgery for lateral epicondylalgia,
	                    at this time there are no published RCTs that indicate that surgery improves the condition over non-surgical
	                    options. There are clinical trials to compare different surgical techniques, but this type of study cannot show
	                    the benefit of surgical intervention over medical treatment or untreated controls, particularly when numerous
	                    studies have documented the tendency for the condition to spontaneously improve over time.<br>
	                    Five articles were reviewed on surgery for lateral epicondylalgia, four studies113,114,115,116 and one meta-analysis.117
	                    One of the studies was of high quality, one of intermediate quality, and two of low quality. The studies evaluated
	                    the following techniques: 1) botulinum toxin injections versus open surgery; 2) percutaneous versus open surgery;
	                    3) lengthening of the distal tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery versus decompression
	                    of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) surgery; and 4) open surgery with drilling versus open surgery with
	                    no drilling. The first study evaluated 40 patients with an average duration of symptoms of 10.5 months—half
	                    were treated with the open (Hohmann) surgical technique and half with botulinum toxin injections.113 The
	                    authors found that “treating chronic tennis elbow with botulinum toxin equal those of operative release.” The
	                    second study evaluated 47 elbows (45 patients who had undergone conservative treatment for 12 months);
	                    24 were treated with a formal open release (Nirschl) surgical technique and 23 with a percutaneous surgical
	                    technique.114 The results showed that “those patients undergoing a percutaneous release returned to work on
	                    average three weeks earlier and improved significantly more quickly than those undergoing an open procedure.
	                    The percutaneous procedure is a quicker and simpler procedure to undertake and produces significantly
	                    better results.” Another study evaluated 28 elbows (26 patients with average duration of symptoms of 23 months);
	                    half were treated with decompression of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) surgery and half with lengthening
	                    of the distal tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery.115 The authors found that the “overall
	                    outcome after a mean follow-up of 31 months after the primary operation was successful in 60% of the cases.”
	                    They concluded that the “present results seem to indicate that PIN neurolysis and lengthening of the tendon
	                    of the ECRB muscle are of similar value in the surgical treatment of resistant tennis elbow. Neither of these
	                    methods, however, can be considered a very effective treatment in chronic tennis elbow.” The last study evaluated
	                    23 elbows (duration of patients symptoms not indicated) and treated them with open (Nirschl) release surgery
	                    with drilling or without drilling.116 The author concluded that “drilling confers no benefit and actually causes
	                    more pain, stiffness, and wound bleeding than not drilling.” Quality studies are available on surgery for
	                    patients with chronic symptoms of lateral epicondylalgia, although they used different surgical techniques
	                    and did not include an observation group. Benefits of less invasive procedures are suggested. This option is
	                    high cost, invasive, and has moderate side effects. Thus, surgery for lateral epicondylalgia should only be a
	                    consideration for those patients who fail to improve after a minimum of 6 months of care that includes at least
	                    3–4 different types of conservative treatment. However, there are unusual circumstances in which, after 3 months
	                    of failed conservative treatment, surgery may be considered [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    B. MEDIAL EPICONDYLALGIA<br>
	                    Quality studies are not available on surgery for medial epicondylalgia. As noted previously, it is recommended
	                    that treatment for medial epicondylalgia be inferred from lateral epicondylalgia; however, some anecdotal
	                    information suggests surgical outcomes for medial epicondylalgia may be somewhat worse. This option is
	                    high cost, invasive, and has moderate side effects. Thus, surgery for medial epicondylalgia should only be a
	                    consideration for those patients who fail to improve after a minimum of 6 months of care that includes at
	                    least 3–4 different types of conservative treatment. However, there are unusual circumstances in which, after
	                    3 months of failed conservative treatment, surgery may be considered [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    C. ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT<br>
	                    Five studies were reviewed for ulnar nerve decompression surgery118,119,120,121,122; all of intermediate quality.
	                    All the studies compared surgical techniques. None incorporated a group receiving physical therapy or
	                    non-intervention as a control. Also, none of the studies distinguished between the different types of ulnar
	                    neuropathies at the elbow. Two studies118,119 compared a simple decompression procedure with anterior
	                    subcutaneous transposition of the ulnar nerve (one did not indicate duration of patients’ symptoms and
	                    the other included patients with symptoms for greater than 3 months); two studies121,122 (one did not indicate
	                    duration of patients’ symptoms and the other had a mean duration of symptoms of 27 months in one group
	                    and 24.9 months in the second group) compared a simple decompression with submuscular transposition;
	                    and one study120 compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition with 52 patients who had
	                    symptoms of at least 3 months. Unfortunately, the more risky and less effective transposition procedures
	                    remain the most common. Evidence is lacking that any of these surgeries has advantages over conservative
	                    treatment. The simple ulnar nerve release does have some evidence of benefits over more complicated
	                    surgical procedures such as transposition.<br>
	                    Surgery for ulnar nerve entrapment requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical evidence
	                    and positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings. A decision to operate requires significant
	                    loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment and that the patient
	                    has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, use of elbow pads, removing opportunities
	                    to rest the elbow on the ulnar groove, workstation changes (if applicable), and avoiding nerve irritation at
	                    night by preventing prolonged elbow flexion while sleeping. Before proceeding with surgery, patients must be
	                    apprised of all possible complications, including wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage,
	                    and the high possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as
	                    muscle wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.<br>
	                    <br>
	                    Simple Decompression<br>
	                    Quality studies118,119,121,122 of patients with chronic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are available on surgical
	                    treatment for ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive,
	                    and have side effects. Yet, in well defined but infrequent cases as outlined above that include positive
	                    electrodiagnostic studies with objective evidence of loss of function, lack of improvement may necessitate
	                    surgery and surgery for this condition is recommended. Compared with more complex procedures, there
	                    is evidence of benefits from simple decompression and this procedure is recommended [Recommended,
	                    Evidence (C)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    Submuscular Transposition<br>
	                    Quality studies121,122 are available on submuscular transposition. Submuscular transposition has not been shown
	                    to be beneficial. This surgical option for this problem is high cost, invasive, and has side effects. Thus, submuscular
	                    transposition is not recommended [Not Recommended, Evidence (C)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    Anterior Transposition<br>
	                    Quality studies118,119,120 are available on anterior transposition for chronic ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow.
	                    Studies show that while effective, the complication rate is higher than for simple decompression. Surgical
	                    options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, in well-defined but infrequent
	                    cases that include positive electrodiagnostic studies with objective evidence of loss of function where at time
	                    of attempted decompression, indications are felt to be present necessitating anterior transposition, this may be
	                    a reasonable option. Thus, subject to these caveats, anterior transposition is recommended [Recommended,
	                    Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    Medial Epicondylectomy<br>
	                    There is one quality study120 of chronic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow available that evaluates anterior
	                    transposition vs. medial epicondylectomy. Neither surgery was clearly beneficial; however, there was less
	                    pain in the group treated with medial epicondylectomy. This surgical option for this problem is high cost,
	                    invasive, has side effects, and may not address the neuropathy. Thus, medial epicondylectomy for ulnar
	                    neuropathy is not recommended [Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    D. RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT (INCLUDING RADIAL TUNNEL SYNDROME)<br>
	                    Surgery for radial nerve entrapment requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical
	                    evidence. Positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings should be present. A decision to operate
	                    requires significant loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment
	                    and that the patient has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, and workstation
	                    changes (if applicable). Before proceeding with surgery, patients must be apprised of all possible complications,
	                    including the extent of the incision, wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage, and the high
	                    possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as muscle
	                    wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.
	                    Quality studies are not available on surgical treatment for radial nerve entrapment and there is not evidence
	                    of its benefits. If, after at least 3–6 months of conservative treatment, the patient fails to show signs of
	                    improvement, surgery may be a reasonable option if there is unequivocal evidence of radial tunnel syndrome
	                    that includes positive electrodiagnostic studies and objective evidence of loss of function as outlined above.
	                    Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, lack of improvement may
	                    in infrequent circumstances necessitate surgery and surgery for this condition is recommended
	                    [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    E. PRONATOR SYNDROME<br>
	                    Surgery for pronator syndrome requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical evidence.
	                    Positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings should be present. A decision to operate requires
	                    significant loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment and that
	                    the patient has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, and workstation changes
	                    (if applicable). Before proceeding with surgery, the patient must be apprised of all possible complications,
	                    including the extent of the incision, wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage, and the
	                    possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as muscle
	                    wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.<br>
	                    Quality studies are not available on surgical treatment for pronator syndrome and there is not evidence of its
	                    benefits. If after at least 3–6 months of conservative treatment the patient fails to show signs of improvement,
	                    surgery may be a reasonable option if there is unequivocal evidence of pronator syndrome that includes
	                    positive electrodiagnostic studies and objective evidence of loss of function as outlined above. Surgical options
	                    for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, lack of improvement may in infrequent
	                    circumstances necessitate surgery; thus, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended,
	                    Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    F. BICEPS RUPTURE<br>
	                    Biceps tendinosis may be severe enough to involve a biceps rupture. This generally occurs in the setting of
	                    supramaximal use of force and requires surgical repair in most employed patients. (It is important to note
	                    that this recommendation is for a biceps tendon rupture, not a bicipital tendon rupture, which occurs in the
	                    bicipital groove at the shoulder and often does not require surgery.) Quality studies are not available on
	                    surgery for biceps ruptures and there is not evidence of benefits due to the low incidence and severity of these
	                    issues. However, while surgery is high cost, invasive, and has some potential for side effects, outcomes appear
	                    much better with surgery as this muscle is the main forearm flexor. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence,
	                    surgery for a ruptured biceps is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    G. OLECRANON BURSITIS (ASEPTIC)<br>
	                    Aseptic (uninfected) olecranon bursitis generally resolves without the need for surgery. Quality studies are
	                    not available on surgical treatment for aseptic olecranon bursitis and there is not evidence of its benefits. If
	                    after at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment the patient fails to show signs of improvement, surgery may
	                    be reasonable. Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and may have more side effects for
	                    this condition than continued conservative care. Yet, lack of improvement may in rare circumstances necessitate
	                    surgery; thus, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
	                    <br>
	                    H. OLECRANON BURSITIS (SEPTIC)<br>
	                    Septic (infected) olecranon bursitis is either a complication of aseptic olecranon bursitis or a direct consequence
	                    of trauma. Generally, to be a complication of aseptic olecranon bursitis also requires introduction of organisms
	                    through the skin, such as abraded skin or an injection. Signs include swelling, pain, tenderness, and pain on
	                    range of motion. Quality studies are not available on this subject and there is not evidence of its benefits;
	                    however, septic olecranon bursitis (especially if loculated) usually requires surgical drainage. Surgical options
	                    are high cost, invasive, but surgical outcomes have few side effects for this condition. Thus, while there is
	                    insufficient evidence, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].
	                    During the recovery phase, treatment options are the same as those for aseptic olecranon bursitis with the
	                    additional treatment of antibiotics that are required from the time the condition is recognized as an infection
	                    [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].

						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Referral for hand surgery consultation may be indicated for patients who:<br>
						Have red flags of a serious nature<br>
						Fail to respond to conservative management, including worksite modifications<br>
						Have clear clinical and special study evidence of a lesion that has been
						shown to benefit, in both the short and long term, from surgical
						intervention<br>
						<br>
						Surgical considerations depend on the confirmed diagnosis of the presenting
						hand or wrist complaint. If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding
						likely outcomes, risks and benefits, and, especially, expectations is very important.
						If there is no clear indication for surgery, referring the patient to a
						physical medicine practitioner may aid in formulating a treatment plan.<br>
						<br>
						A. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>
						Surgical decompression of the median nerve usually relieves CTS symptoms.
						High-quality scientific evidence shows success in the majority of patients with
						an electrodiagnostically confirmed diagnosis of CTS. Patients with the mildest
						symptoms display the poorest postsurgery results; patients with moderate or
						severe CTS have better outcomes from surgery than splinting. CTS must be
						proved by positive findings on clinical examination and the diagnosis should
						be supported by nerve-conduction tests before surgery is undertaken. Mild
						CTS with normal electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) exists, but moderate or
						severe CTS with normal EDS is very rare. Positive EDS in asymptomatic
						individuals is not CTS. Studies have not shown portable nerve conduction
						devices to be effective diagnostic tools. Surgery will not relieve any symptoms
						from cervical radiculopathy (double crush syndrome). Likewise, diabetic patients
						with peripheral neuropathy cannot expect full recovery and total abatement
						of symptoms after nerve decompression.<br>
						Risks of surgical decompression include complications of anesthesia,wound
						infection,anddamageto themediannerve.Incompletedecompression or recurrence
						of symptoms can lead to the need for further surgery. Based on the data
						fromthe randomized controlled trials, endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to
						be an effective procedure compared to open surgery; however, greater emphasis
						must be given to training surgeons in this technique to avoid major complications
						such as median nerve injuries.With proper training and equipment, endoscopic
						carpal tunnel release can be done safely, with complication rates
						comparable to those for the open technique and with high patient satisfaction.
						Early return to work after either type carpal tunnel surgery is more dependent
						on the willingness of the employer and patient than on the surgical technique.
						Two prospective randomized studies show no beneficial effect from postoperative
						splinting after carpal tunnel release when compared to a bulky dressing
						alone. In fact, splinting the wrist beyond 48 hours following CTS release may
						be largely detrimental, especially compared to a home therapy program.<br>
						<br>
						B. Trigger Finger<br>
						One or two injections of lidocaine and corticosteroids into or near the thickened
						area of the flexor tendon sheath of the affected finger are almost always
						sufficient to cure symptoms and restore function. A procedure under local
						anesthesia may be necessary to permanently correct persistent triggering.<br>
						<br>
						C. DeQuervain’s Syndrome<br>
						The majority of patients with DeQuervain’s syndrome will have resolution
						of symptoms with conservative treatment. Under unusual circumstances of
						persistent pain at the wrist and limitation of function, surgery may be an
						option for treating DeQuervain’s tendinitis. Surgery, however, carries similar
						risks and complications as those already mentioned above (see A, ‘‘Carpal
						Tunnel Syndrome’’), including the possibility of damage to the radial nerve
						at the wrist because it is in the area of the incision.<br>
						<br>
						D. Ganglion<br>
						Only symptomatic wrist ganglia merit or excision, if aspiration fails. Recurrences
						may be spontaneous or related to inadequate removal of the communication
						with the carpal joints or to satellite ganglia that the surgeon failed to excise.<br>

						&sect; 9792.23.5. Low Back Complaints<br>
						American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2nd Edition<br>
						Chapter 12 &ndash; Low Back Complaints<br>
						Table 12-8 Summary of Recommendations for Evaluating and Managing Low Back Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure:  Surgical considerations<br>
						Recommended:  Discuss surgical options with patients with persistent and severe sciatica and clinical evidence of nerve root compromise if symptoms persist after 4-6 weeks of conservative therapy (B), Standard Discectomy or microdiscectomy for herniated disk (procedures have similar efficacy) (B)<br>
						Optional:  Chymopapain, used after ruling out allergic sensitivity, acceptable but less efficacious than Discectomy to treat herniated disk (C)<br>
						Not Recommended:  Disk surgery in patients with back pain alone, no red flags, and no nerve root compression (D), Surgery for spinal stenosis when justified by imaging test rather than patient’s functional status (D), Spinal fusion in the absence of fracture, dislocation, complications of tumor, or infection (C)<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Within the first three months after onset of acute low back symptoms, surgery
						is considered only when serious spinal pathology or nerve root dysfunction
						not responsive to conservative therapy (and obviously due to a herniated disk)
						is detected. Disk herniation, characterized by protrusion of the central nucleus
						pulposus through a defect in the outer annulus fibrosis, may impinge on a
						nerve root, causing irritation, back and leg symptoms, and nerve root dysfunction.
						The presence of a herniated disk on an imaging study, however, does
						not necessarily imply nerve root dysfunction. Studies of asymptomatic adults
						commonly demonstrate intervertebral disk herniations that apparently do not
						cause symptoms. Some studies show spontaneous disk resorption without
						surgery, while others suggest that pain may be due to irritation of the dorsal
						root ganglion by inflammogens (metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, interleukin-
						6, prostaglandin E2) released from a damaged disk in the absence of anatomical
						evidence of direct contact between neural elements and disk material. Therefore,
						referral for surgical consultation is indicated for patients who have:<br>
						Severe and disabling lower leg symptoms in a distribution consistent
						with abnormalities on imaging studies (radiculopathy), preferably with
						accompanying objective signs of neural compromise<br>
						Activity limitations due to radiating leg pain for more than one month
						or extreme progression of lower leg symptoms<br>
						Clear clinical, imaging, and electrophysiologic evidence of a lesion
						that has been shown to benefit in both the short and long term from
						surgical repair<br>
						Failure of conservative treatment to resolve disabling radicular symptoms<br>
						<br>
						If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks and
						benefits, and, especially, expectations is very important. Patients with acute
						low back pain alone, without findings of serious conditions or significant nerve
						root compromise, rarely benefit from either surgical consultation or surgery.
						If there is no clear indication for surgery, referring the patient to a physical
						medicine practitioner may help resolve the symptoms.<br>
						Before referral for surgery, clinicians should consider referral for psychological
						screening to improve surgical outcomes, possibly including standard tests
						such as the second edition of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
						(MMPI-2). In addition, clinicians may look for Waddell signs during the
						physical exam.<br>
						Many patients with strong clinical findings of nerve root dysfunction due
						to disk herniation recover activity tolerance within one month; there is no
						evidence that delaying surgery for this period worsens outcomes in the absence
						of progressive nerve root compromise. With or without surgery, more than
						80% of patients with apparent surgical indications eventually recover. Although
						surgery appears to speed short- to mid-term recovery, surgical morbidity
						(recovery and rehabilitation time and effects) and complications must be
						considered. Surgery benefits fewer than 40% of patients with questionable
						physiologic findings. Moreover, surgery increases the need for future surgical
						procedures with higher complication rates. In good surgery centers, the overall
						incidence of complications from first-time disk surgery is less than 1%. However,
						for older patients and repeat procedures, the rate of complications is
						dramatically higher. Patients with comorbid conditions, such as cardiac or
						respiratory disease, diabetes, or mental illness, may be poor candidates for
						surgery. Comorbidity should be weighed and discussed carefully with the
						patient. Following surgery, exercise is much better than manipulation for
						rehabilitation.<br>
						<br>
						A. Lumbosacral Nerve Root Decompression<br>
						Direct methods of nerve root decompression include laminotomy, standard
						diskectomy, and laminectomy. Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain is an example
						of an indirect method. Indirect chemical methods are less efficacious
						and have rare but serious complications (e.g., anaphylaxis, arachnoiditis). Percutaneous
						diskectomy is not recommended because proof of its effectiveness
						has not been demonstrated. Recent studies of chemonucleolysis have shown
						it to be more effective than placebo, and it is less invasive, but less effective, than
						surgical diskectomy; however, few providers are experienced in this procedure
						because it is not widely used anymore. Surgical diskectomy for carefully selected
						patients with nerve root compression due to lumbar disk prolapse provides
						faster relief from the acute attack than conservative management; but any
						positive or negative effects on the lifetime natural history of the underlying
						disk disease are still unclear. Given the extremely low level of evidence available
						for artificial disk replacement or percutaneous endoscopic laser diskectomy
						(PELD), it is recommended that these procedures be regarded as experimental
						at this time.<br>
						<br>
						B. Intradiskal Electrothermal Annuloplasty<br>
						Intradiskal electrothermal annuloplasty may show some advantages over diskectomy,
						but IDET is operator dependent and not considered ready for wholesale
						use by the public. Early outcomes may exaggerate the efficacy of IDET
						because some who initially improve later deteriorate. In addition, studies of
						IDET have relied on diskography, a technique not well supported by the
						medical evidence.<br>
						<br>
						C. Implantable Spinal Cord Stimulators<br>
						Implantable spinal cord stimulators are rarely used and should be reserved
						for patients with low back pain for more than six months duration who have
						not responded to the standard nonoperative or operative interventions.<br>
						<br>
						D. Management of Spinal Stenosis<br>
						Spinal stenosis usually results from soft tissue and bony encroachment of the
						spinal canal and nerve roots. It has a gradual onset and usually manifests as
						a degenerative process after age 50. Evidence does not currently support a
						relationship with work. The surgical treatment for spinal stenosis is usually
						complete laminectomy. Elderly patients with spinal stenosis who tolerate their
						daily activities usually do not require surgery unless bowel or bladder dysfunction
						develops. Surgery is rarely considered in the first three months after onset
						of symptoms, and a decision to proceed with surgery should not be based
						solely on the results of imaging studies. Some evidence suggests that patients
						with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit more from surgery than from
						conservative treatment.<br>
						<br>
						E. Spinal Fusion<br>
						Except for cases of trauma-related spinal fracture or dislocation, fusion of the
						spine is not usually considered during the first three months of symptoms.
						Patients with increased spinal instability (not work-related) after surgical decompression
						at the level of degenerative spondylolisthesis may be candidates
						for fusion. There is no scientific evidence about the long-term effectiveness
						of any form of surgical decompression or fusion for degenerative lumbar
						spondylosis compared with natural history, placebo, or conservative treatment.
						There is no good evidence from controlled trials that spinal fusion alone is
						effective for treating any type of acute low back problem, in the absence of
						spinal fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis if there is instability and motion
						in the segment operated on. It is important to note that although it is being
						undertaken, lumbar fusion in patients with other types of low back pain very
						seldom cures the patient. A recent study has shown that only 29% assessed
						themselves as ‘‘much better’’ in the surgical group versus 14% ‘‘much better’’
						in the nonfusion group (a 15% greater chance of being ‘‘much better’’) versus
						a 17% complication rate (including 9% life-threatening or reoperation).<br>

						Table 13-6 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Knee Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure:  Surgical considerations<br>
						Recommended:  Arthroscopic meniscectomy or repair for severe mechanical symptoms and signs or serious activity limitations if MRI findings are consistent for meniscal tear (C, D), ACL repair for symptomatic instability (i.e., serious activity limitation) if results of Lachman and pivot-shift tests and MRI are positive (C, D)<br>
						Optional:  ACL reconstruction before rehabilitation has been attempted (C, D)<br>
						Not Recommended:  Surgical repair of isolated MCL ruptures (D)
						Immediate surgical reconstruction of all ACL tears on basis of MRI findings without physical findings confirming diagnosis or worker life demands requiring high knee performance (D)<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Referral for surgical consultation may be indicated for patients who have:<br>
						Activity limitation for more than one month; and<br>
						Failure of exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength
						of the musculature around the knee.<br>
						<br>
						Earlier, emergency consultation is reserved for patients who may require
						drainage of acute effusions or hematomas. Referral for early repair of ligament
						or meniscus tears is still a matter for study because many patients can have
						satisfactory results with physical rehabilitation and avoid surgical risk.<br>
						<br>
						A. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears<br>
						Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction generally is warranted only for patients
						who have significant symptoms of instability caused by ACL incompetence.
						Anterior cruciate ligament tears often are followed by an immediate
						effusion of the knee. A history of frequent giving-way episodes, or falls during
						activities that involve knee rotation, is consistent with the condition. A physical
						examination in an acute setting may be unrevealing because of the effusion
						and immobilization of the knee. In addition, the physical examination may
						reveal clear signs of instability as shown by positive Lachman, drawer, and
						pivot-shift tests. It is important to confirm the clinical findings with MRI
						evidence of a complete tear in the ligament. Especially in cases involving partial
						ACLtears, substantial improvement in symptoms may occur with rehabilitation
						alone. In complete tears, consideration should be given to the patient’s age,
						normal activity level, and the degree of knee instability caused by the tear.
						Surgical reconstruction of the ACL may provide substantial benefit to active
						patients, especially those under 50 years old. For the patient whose work or
						life does not require significant loading of the knee and other stressful conditions,
						ACL repair may not be necessary.<br>
						Complications of wound infection and untoward anesthetic events are
						possible but rare. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is noted in the
						literature to have various rates of failure, and it is appropriate to warn the
						patient of this possibility. After the procedure, the rehabilitation period involves
						six months of intense concentration and work by the patient; the patient’s
						willingness to undergo the rehabilitative process must be determined by the
						practitioner and may be discussed with the patient. Besides providing
						the patient with educational literature, the practitioner may want to have the
						patient meet with someone who is going through the rehabilitation process.
						Such a meeting might help the patient determine whether he or she will be
						able to follow through with the intense process. Older patients may be less
						motivated to go through rehabilitation, and the work environment can be
						examined before deciding upon the need for ACL repair.<br>
						<br>
						B. Meniscus Tears<br>
						Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy usually has a high success rate for cases in
						which there is clear evidence of a meniscus tear—symptoms other than simply
						pain (locking, popping, giving way, recurrent effusion); clear signs of a buckethandle
						tear on examination (tenderness over the suspected tear but not over
						the entire joint line, and perhaps lack of full passive flexion); and consistent
						findings on MRI. However, patients suspected of having meniscal tears, but
						without progressive or severe activity limitation, can be encouraged to live
						with symptoms to retain the protective effect of the meniscus. If symptoms
						are lessening, conservative methods can maximize healing. In patients younger
						than 35, arthroscopic meniscal repair can preserve meniscal function, although
						the recovery time is longer compared to partial meniscectomy. Arthroscopy
						and meniscus surgery may not be equally beneficial for those patients who
						are exhibiting signs of degenerative changes.<br>
						<br>
						C. Collateral Ligament Tears<br>
						Isolated collateral ligament tears have been shown to heal with excellent results
						without surgical intervention. When accompanying cruciate or meniscus injuries
						are ruled out, the patient can be treated non-operatively. Rehabilitative
						exercises will be needed.<br>
						<br>
						D. Patellofemoral Syndrome<br>
						Although arthroscopic patellar shaving has been performed frequently for
						PFS, long-term improvement has not been proved and its efficacy is questionable.
						Severe patellar degeneration presents a problem not easily treated by
						surgery. Patellectomy and patellar replacements in reasonably active patients
						yield inconsistent results, and the procedures have a reasonable place only
						in treating patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis or another rheumatoid
						condition. Lateral arthroscopic release may be indicated in cases of recurrent
						subluxation of the patella, but surgical realignment of the extensor mechanism
						may be indicated in some patients.<br>

						American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2nd Edition<br>
						Chapter 14 &ndash; Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
						Table 14-6 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure:  Surgical considerations<br>
						Recommended:  Bunionectomy if conservative treatment fails and radiographs are positive for > 14-degree intermetatarsal angle (D), Excision of neuroma if conservative treatment (injections, toe separator) fails (D), Reconstruction of lateral ankle ligament for symptomatic patients with ankle laxity demonstrated on physical exam and positive stress films (C)<br>
						Not Recommended:  Diagnostic arthroscopy of ankle if diagnosis obtainable by other non-invasive method (D), Arthroscopy of ankle for synovial impingement before conservative care, including injections, is tried (D)<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						Surgical Considerations<br>
						Referral for surgical consultation may be indicated for patients who have:<br>
						Activity limitation for more than one month without signs of functional
						improvement<br>
						Failure of exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength
						of the musculature around the ankle and foot<br>
						Clear clinical and imaging evidence of a lesion that has been shown
						to benefit in both the short and long term from surgical repair<br>
						<br>
						Earlier, emergency consultation is reserved for patients who may require
						drainage of acute effusions or hematomas. Referral for early repair of ligament
						tears is controversial and not common practice. Repairs are generally reserved
						for chronic instability. Most patients have satisfactory results with physical
						rehabilitation and thus avoid the risks of surgery. If there is no clear indication
						for surgery, referring the patient to a physical medicine practitioner may help
						resolve the symptoms.<br>
						<br>
						A. Neuroma<br>
						If a patient with a neuroma has persistent pain in a web space despite using
						toe separators, along with temporary relief from local cortisone injections,
						surgical removal of the neuroma may be indicated. Besides the usual counseling
						about possible wound complications and complications of anesthesia, the
						patient can be informed that the operation is not always effective because the
						surgeon may be unable to find the neuroma and excise it. Always counsel
						the patient about expectations for surgery so that he or she can make an
						informed decision about whether or not to proceed with surgery.<br>
						<br>
						B. Hallux Valgus<br>
						Failure of conservative treatment (e.g., using wider shoes and/or arch supports,
						or aspiration of an overlying bursa) may lead to consideration of surgery.
						However, surgery should not be performed for cosmetic purposes because surgical
						complications such as infection can worsen appearance and a good
						functional result is the goal of treatment. Counseling patients about the
						postoperative course and recovery period is required because they may otherwise
						underestimate the length of time for recovery and the postoperative pain
						involved.<br>
