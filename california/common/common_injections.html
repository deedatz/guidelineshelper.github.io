						&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
						Botulinum toxin (Botox; Myobloc)<br>
						Not generally recommended for chronic pain disorders, but recommended for cervical dystonia. See more details below.<br>
						Not recommended for the following: tension-type headache; migraine headache; fibromyositis; chronic neck pain; myofascial pain syndrome; & trigger point injections.<br>
						Several recent studies have found no statistical support for the use of Botulinum toxin A (BTX A)for any of the following:<br>
						The evidence is mixed for migraine headaches. This RCT found that both botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) and divalproex sodium (DVPX) significantly reduced disability associated with migraine, and BoNTA had a favorable tolerability profile compared with DVPX. (Blumenfeld, 2008) In this RCT of episodic migraine patients, low-dose injections of BoNTA into the frontal, temporal, and/or glabellar muscle regions were not more effective than placebo. (Saper, 2007) Botulinum neurotoxin is probably ineffective in episodic migraine and chronic tension-type headache (Level B). (Naumann, 2008)<br>
						Myofascial analgesic pain relief as compared to saline. (Qerama, 2006)<br>
						Use as a specific treatment for myofascial cervical pain as compared to saline. (Ojala, 2006) (Ferrante, 2005) (Wheeler, 1998)<br>
						Injection in myofascial trigger points as compared to dry needling or local anesthetic injections. (Kamanli, 2005) (Graboski, 2005).<br>
						Recent systematic reviews have stated that current evidence does not support the use of BTX-A trigger point injections for myofascial pain.  (Ho, 2006) Or for mechanical neck disease (as compared to saline).  (Peloso-Cochrane, 2006)  A recent study that has found statistical improvement with the use of BTX-A compared to saline.  Study patients had at least 10 trigger points and no patient in the study was allowed to take an opioid in the 4 weeks prior to treatment.  (Gobel, 2006)<br>
						Recommended: cervical dystonia, a condition that is not generally related to workers' compensation injuries (also known as spasmodic torticolis), and is characterized as a movement disorder of the nuchal muscles, characterized by tremor or by tonic posturing of the head in a rotated, twisted, or abnormally flexed or extended position or some combination of these positions.  When treated with BTX-B, high antigenicity limits long-term efficacy. Botulinum toxin A injections provide more objective and subjective benefit than trihexyphenidyl or other anticholinergic drugs to patients with cervical dystonia.<br>
						Recommended: chronic low back pain, if a favorable initial response predicts subsequent responsiveness, as an option in conjunction with a functional restoration program.  Some additional new data suggests that it may be effective for low back pain. (Jabbari, 2006) (Ney, 2006) Botulinum neurotoxin may be considered for low back pain (Level C). (Naumann, 2008)<br>

						&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
						Epidural steroid injections (ESIs)<br/>
						Recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain (defined as pain in dermatomal distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy). See specific criteria for use below. Most current guidelines recommend no more than 2 ESI injections. This is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a &quot;series of three&quot; ESIs. These early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Research has now shown that, on average, less than two injections are required for a successful ESI outcome. Current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection, and a third ESI is rarely recommended. Epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts, including continuing a home exercise program. There is little information on improved function. The American Academy of Neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between 2 and 6 weeks following the injection, but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months, and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain. (Armon, 2007) See also Epidural steroid injections, &quot;series of three.&quot;<br>
						Criteria for the use of Epidural steroid injections:<br>
						Note: The purpose of ESI is to reduce pain and inflammation, restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs, and avoiding surgery, but this treatment alone offers no significant long-term functional benefit.<br>
						1) Radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and/or electrodiagnostic testing.<br>
						2) Initially unresponsive to conservative treatment (exercises, physical methods, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants).<br>
						3) Injections should be performed using fluoroscopy (live x-ray) for guidance.<br>
						4) If used for diagnostic purposes, a maximum of two injections should be performed. A second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block. Diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections.<br>
						5) No more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks.<br>
						6) No more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session.<br>
						7) In the therapeutic phase, repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement, including at least 50% pain relief with associated reduction of medication use for six to eight weeks, with a general recommendation of no more than 4 blocks per region per year. (Manchikanti, 2003) (CMS, 2004) (Boswell, 2007)<br>
						8) Current research does not support a &quot;series-of-three&quot; injections in either the diagnostic or therapeutic phase. We recommend no more than 2 ESI injections.

					<td>California Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule<br>
						&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
						Trigger point injections<br>
						Recommended only for myofascial pain syndrome as indicated below, with limited lasting value. Not recommended for radicular pain.  Trigger point injections with an anesthetic such as bupivacaine are recommended for non-resolving trigger points, but the addition of a corticosteroid is not generally recommended. Not recommended for radicular pain. A trigger point is a discrete focal tenderness located in a palpable taut band of skeletal muscle, which produces a local twitch in response to stimulus to the band.  Trigger points may be present in up to 33-50% of the adult population. Myofascial pain syndrome is a regional painful muscle condition with a direct relationship between a specific trigger point and its associated pain region. These injections may occasionally be necessary to maintain function in those with myofascial problems when myofascial trigger points are present on examination.  Not recommended for typical back pain or neck pain.  (Graff-Radford, 2004) (Nelemans-Cochrane, 2002) For fibromyalgia syndrome, trigger point injections have not been proven effective. (Goldenberg, 2004)<br>
						Criteria for the use of Trigger point injections:<br>
						Trigger point injections with a local anesthetic may be recommended for the treatment of chronic low back or neck pain with myofascial pain syndrome when all of the following criteria are met:<br>
						(1) Documentation of circumscribed trigger points with evidence upon palpation of a twitch response as well as referred pain;<br>
						(2) Symptoms have persisted for more than three months;<br>
						(3) Medical management therapies such as ongoing stretching exercises, physical therapy, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants have failed to control pain;<br>
						(4) Radiculopathy is not present (by exam, imaging, or neuro-testing);<br>
						(5) Not more than 3-4 injections per session;<br>
						(6) No repeat injections unless a greater than 50% pain relief is obtained for six weeks after an injection and there is documented evidence of functional improvement;<br>
						(7) Frequency should not be at an interval less than two months;<br>
						(8) Trigger point injections with any substance (e.g., saline or glucose) other than local anesthetic with or without steroid are not recommended. (Colorado, 2002) (BlueCross BlueShield, 2004)<br>
