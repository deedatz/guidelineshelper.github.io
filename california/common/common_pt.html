						&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
						Physical Medicine<br>
						Recommended as indicated below. Passive therapy (those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient) can provide short term relief during the early phases of pain treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation and swelling and to improve the rate of healing soft tissue injuries. They can be used sparingly with active therapies to help control swelling, pain and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. Active therapy is based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task. This form of therapy may require supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). Patients are instructed and expected to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. (Colorado, 2002) (Airaksinen, 2006) Patient&ndash;specific hand therapy is very important in reducing swelling, decreasing pain, and improving range of motion in CRPS. (Li, 2005) The use of active treatment modalities (e.g., exercise, education, activity modification) instead of passive treatments is associated with substantially better clinical outcomes. In a large case series of patients with low back pain treated by physical therapists, those adhering to guidelines for active rather than passive treatments incurred fewer treatment visits, cost less, and had less pain and less disability. The overall success rates were 64.7% among those adhering to the active treatment recommendations versus 36.5% for passive treatment. (Fritz, 2007)<br>

			                Used after surgery and amputation. During immobilization, there was weak evidence of improved hand function in the short term, but not in the longer term, for early occupational therapy, and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises. Post-immobilization, there was weak evidence of a lack of clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving formal rehabilitation therapy, passive mobilization or whirlpool immersion compared with no intervention. There was weak evidence of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion (post external fixation), intermittent pneumatic compression and ultrasound. There was weak evidence of better short-term hand function in patients given therapy than in those given instructions for home exercises by a surgeon.

			                As compared with no therapy, therapy (up to 20 sessions over 12 weeks) following disc herniation surgery was effective. Because of the limited benefits of therapy relative to massage, it is open to question whether this treatment acts primarily physiologically, but psychological factors may contribute substantially to the benefits observed.

			                Controversy exists about the effectiveness of therapy after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. (Goodwin, 2003) Functional exercises after hospital discharge for total knee arthroplasty result in a small to moderate short-term, but not long-term, benefit. In the short term therapy interventions with exercises based on functional activities may be more effective after total knee arthroplasty than traditional exercise programs, which concentrate on isometric muscle exercises and exercises to increase range of motion in the joint. (Minns Lowe, 2007) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

			                Patient rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury is divided into two periods: acute and subacute. In the beginning of rehabilitation therapist evaluates patient's functional status, later he uses methods and means of treatment, and evaluates effectiveness of rehabilitation. Early ambulation is very important for patients with coma. Therapy consists of prevention of complications, improvement of muscle force, and range of motions, balance, movement coordination, endurance and cognitive functions. Early rehabilitation is necessary for traumatic brain injury patients and use of therapy methods can help to regain lost functions and to come back to the society.

			            Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>
			            <p>
			                Recommended as indicated below. There is limited evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PT (physical therapy) or OT (occupational therapy) for CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome). The evidence may justify 3 to 5 visits over 4 weeks after surgery, up to the maximums shown below. Benefits need to be documented after the first week, and prolonged therapy visits are not supported. Carpal tunnel syndrome should not result in extended time off work while undergoing multiple therapy visits, when other options (including surgery for carefully selected patients) could result in faster return to work. Furthermore, carpal tunnel release surgery is a relatively simple operation that also should not require extended multiple therapy office visits for recovery. Of course, these statements do not apply to cases of failed surgery and/or misdiagnosis (e.g., CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) I instead of CTS). (Feuerstein, 1999) (O'Conner-Cochrane, 2003) (Verhagen-Cochrane, 2004) (APTA, 2006) (Bilic, 2006) Post surgery, a home therapy program is superior to extended splinting. (Cook, 1995) Continued visits should be contingent on documentation of objective improvement, i.e., VAS (visual analog scale) improvement greater than four, and long-term resolution of symptoms. Therapy should include education in a home program, work discussion and suggestions for modifications, lifestyle changes, and setting realistic expectations. Passive modalities, such as heat, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, ultrasound and electrical stimulation, should be minimized in favor of active treatments.<br>

			            <p>
			                A therapy program that starts immediately following hip surgery allows for greater improvement in muscle strength, walking speed and functional score. (Jan, 2004) (Jain, 2002) (Penrod, 2004) (Tsauo, 2005) (Brigham, 2003) (White, 2005) (National, 2003) A weight-bearing exercise program can improve balance and functional ability to a greater extent than a non-weight-bearing program. (Expert, 2004) (Binder, 2004) (Bolgla, 2005) (Handoll, 2004) (Kuisma, 2002) (Lauridsen, 2002) (Mangione, 2005) (Sherrington, 2004) Patients with hip fracture should be offered a coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation program with the specific aim of regaining sufficient function to return to their pre-fracture living arrangements. (Cameron, 2005) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

						&sect; 9792.24.2. Chronic Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines<br>
			            Work conditioning, work hardening<br>
						Recommended as an option, depending on the availability of quality programs.<br>
						Criteria for admission to a Work Hardening Program:<br>
						(1) Work related musculoskeletal condition with functional limitations precluding ability to safely achieve current job demands, which are in the medium or higher demand level (i.e., not clerical/sedentary work). An FCE may be required showing consistent results with maximal effort, demonstrating capacities below an employer verified physical demands analysis (PDA).<br>
						(2) After treatment with an adequate trial of physical or occupational therapy with improvement followed by plateau, but not likely to benefit from continued physical or occupational therapy, or general conditioning.<br>
						(3) Not a candidate where surgery or other treatments would clearly be warranted to improve function.<br>
						(4) Physical and medical recovery sufficient to allow for progressive reactivation and participation for a minimum of 4 hours a day for three to five days a week.<br>
						(5) A defined return to work goal agreed to by the employer & employee:<br>
						(a) A documented specific job to return to with job demands that exceed abilities, OR<br>
						(b) Documented on-the-job training<br>
						(6) The worker must be able to benefit from the program (functional and psychological limitations that are likely to improve with the program). Approval of these programs should require a screening process that includes file review, interview and testing to determine likelihood of success in the program.<br>
						(7) The worker must be no more than 2 years past date of injury. Workers that have not returned to work by two years post injury may not benefit.<br>
						(8) Program timelines: Work Hardening Programs should be completed in 4 weeks consecutively or less.<br>
						(9) Treatment is not supported for longer than 1-2 weeks without evidence of patient compliance and demonstrated significant gains as documented by subjective and objective gains and measurable improvement in functional abilities.<br>
						(10) Upon completion of a rehabilitation program (e.g. work hardening, work conditioning, outpatient medical rehabilitation) neither re-enrollment in nor repetition of the same or similar rehabilitation program is medically warranted for the same condition or injury.<br>
						ODG Physical Medicine Guidelines – Work Conditioning<br>
						10 visits over 8 weeks<br>
						See also Physical medicine for general guidelines.<br>
						And, as with all physical medicine programs, Work Conditioning participation does not preclude concurrently being at work.<br>
