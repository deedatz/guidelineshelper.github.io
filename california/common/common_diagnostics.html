						American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2nd Edition<br>
						Chapter 8 &ndash; Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br>
						For most patients presenting with true neck or upper back problems, special studies are not needed unless a three- or four-week period of conservative care and observation fails to improve symptoms. Most patients improve quickly, provided any red-flag conditions are ruled out. Criteria for ordering imaging studies are:<br>
						Emergence of a red flag<br>
						Physiologic evidence of tissue insult or neurologic dysfunction<br>
						Failure to progress in a strengthening program intended to avoid surgery<br>
						Clarification of the anatomy prior to an invasive procedure <br>
						Table 8&ndash;8 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Neck and Upper Back Complaints<br>
						Clinical Measure: Other imaging procedures<br>
						Recommended: MRI or CT to evaluate red-flag diagnoses as above (D), MRI or CT to validate diagnosis of nerve root compromise, based on clear history and physical examination findings, in preparation for invasive procedure (D), If no improvement after 1 month, bone scan if tumor or infection possible (D)<br>
						Not Recommended: Imaging before 4 to 6 weeks in absence of red flags (C, D)<br>

						American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2nd Edition<br>
						Chapter 14 &ndash; Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
						Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
						For most cases presenting with true foot and ankle disorders, special studies are usually not needed until after a period of conservative care and observation. Most ankle and foot problems improve quickly once any red-flag issues are ruled out. Routine testing, i.e., laboratory tests, plain-film radiographs of the foot or ankle, and special imaging studies are not recommended during the first month of activity limitation, except when a red flag noted on history or examination raises suspicion of a dangerous foot or ankle condition or of referred pain.<br>
						Disorders of soft tissue (such as tendinitis, metatarsalgia, fasciitis, and neuroma) yield negative radiographs and do not warrant other studies, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful to clarify a diagnosis such as osteochondritis dissecans in cases of delayed recovery.<br>
