IMPACT<br>
Upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders continue to account for a significant number of work-related
illnesses and disabilities in the United States (US). According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, non-traumatic
musculoskeletal account for 65% of all occupational illnesses in the US. Work-related elbow disorders are
among the most common causes of reported occupational injuries and workers’ compensation claims. These
disorders are broadly and most accurately classified as musculoskeletal disorders. In 2005 alone, musculoskeletal
disorders accounted for 30% of the injuries and illnesses with days away from work. Specifically, in 2005,
31.5% of elbow injuries resulted in 31 days or more away from work (with a median of 14 days).<br>
Upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders, which include the elbow, now account for at least 4% of all state
workers’ compensation claims, a dramatic increase from the 1% seen a decade ago.5,6,7 The State of Washington,
for example, in reviewing its workers’ compensation claims from 1987 to 1995, found that elbow disorders
accounted for the third highest incidence rate with 29.7 injuries per 10,000 full-time employees.<br>
<br>
GENERAL SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
Recommendations for assessing and treating patients with elbow disorders:<br>
The initial assessment of patients with acute and subacute elbow problems should focus on detecting
clinical indications of potentially serious disease, termed red flags, and determining an accurate diagnosis.<br>
In the absence of red flags, health care providers can safely and effectively manage work-related
elbow disorders. Management should focus on monitoring patients for complications, facilitating
the healing process, and returning the individual to modified, alternative, or full-duty work.<br>
One role of the physician or other health care provider (e.g., physical therapist, occupational therapist,
nurse, etc.) is to identify and correct or modify the offending or aggravating activity. Consultation
with a qualified professional trained in ergonomic analysis can be helpful. Equipment may need to
be serviced or adjusted to reduce the force required to accomplish a job task or to reduce vibration.
Posture and work technique may need to be changed to address, for example, excessive grip force,
contact pressure, or sustained wrist extension. Ergonomic biomechanical advice on the efficient use of
the elbow is helpful. For example, with lateral epicondylalgia/epicondylitis/tendinosis, it is generally
correct to lift with palm up and not palm down to reduce stress on the lateral elbow (caused by resisted
wrist extension). For medial epicondylalgia/epicondylitis/tendinosis, it is generally correct to lift palm
down to avoid stress on the medial elbow (caused by resisted wrist flexion).<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by temporarily decreasing or modifying the
offending activities and by prescribing systemic or topical non-prescription analgesics along with an
adjustable, properly fitted elbow support. Patients recovering from acute and subacute elbow problems
should be encouraged to continue working. Modified duty may be recommended if appropriate.<br>
In general, immobilization should be avoided. An exception is immediately after surgery where brief
immobilization may be required. Wrist splinting is sometimes utilized. However, some experts believe
splinting potentially contributes to elbow pain. When immobilization is utilized, range-of-motion exercises
should involve the elbow, wrist, as well as the shoulder, to avoid frozen shoulder (“adhesive capsulitis”).<br>
If significant symptoms causing self-limitations or restrictions persist beyond 4–6 weeks, referral for
specialty evaluation (e.g., occupational medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or orthopaedic
surgery) may be indicated to assist in the confirmation of the provisional diagnosis and in the
determination of further management.<br>
Acareful search for regional or systemic symptoms, signs, and disorders should be undertaken particularly
in cases of chronic or persistent problems. As there is not scientific consensus on categorization of
symptoms, for purposes of discussion, acute symptoms are defined as those presenting for less than
1 month; subacute symptoms, 1–3 months; and chronic symptoms, greater than 3 months.<br>
Non-physical factors (i.e., psychiatric, psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic issues) should be
investigated and addressed, particularly in cases of delayed recovery or delayed return to work.
These factors are often not overt and specific inquiries are required to identify these issues.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that many of these conditions, particularly lateral epicondylalgia or epicondylitis and
other tendinoses, tend to resolve spontaneously (e.g., see “wait and see” groups within studies of corticosteroid
injections9,10). Thus, in evaluating research studies, including prospective studies, that do not include a placebo
control, caution should be exerted as results may be interpreted as showing benefit even when there is not
true improvement from the therapy beyond normal spontaneous resolution.<br>
<br>
BASIC PRINCIPLES<br>
<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
Inflammation:<br>
A localized protective response elicited by an injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy,
dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is characterized
in the acute form by four classical signs: 1) pain (dolor); 2) heat (calor); 3) redness (rubor); and 4)
swelling (tumor). Loss of function (functio laesa) may also occur. Histologically, inflammation involves
a complex series of events, including dilatation of arterioles, capillaries, and venules, with increased
permeability and blood flow; exudation of fluids, including plasma proteins; and leukocytic migration
into the inflammatory focus. Classic inflammatory responses are found in infectious diseases. Most
musculoskeletal disorders of the elbow only exhibit one of the classic signs of inflammation11—that of
pain; therefore, these disorders do not qualify as an acute inflammatory process in which three of the
four classical signs must be present.<br>
<br>
Tendinitis:<br>
Inflammation within the tendon or tendon insertion with the clinical signs of redness, heat, and
swelling accompanied by pain and decreased range of movement. While “tendinitis” is a widely used term
diagnostically, there is general supposition that inflammation is present.<br>
<br>
Enthesitis:<br>
Inflammation of the muscular or tendinous attachment to bone.<br>
<br>
Enthesopathy:<br>
Disorder of the muscular or tendinous attachment to bone.<br>
<br>
Epicondylitis:<br>
Inflammation of the lateral or medial epicondyle of the elbow (humerus) from any cause.<br>
<br>
Epicondylalgia:<br>
Pain in the epicondyle from any cause. It can be at the origin of a tendon or be referred pain.<br>
<br>
Tendinosis:<br>
A chronic degenerative tendon injury, unaccompanied by redness or heat. It is associated with pain and
limited movement. Tendinosis may be due to an interaction of individual and physical factors, which
may include vocational and avocational activities. In theory, micro-injuries gradually accumulate faster
than they can heal and become clinically apparent when the area becomes painful. Tendinoses are the
most commonly seen types of elbow musculoskeletal disorders.<br>
<br>
The severity of all of these disorders is thought to be influenced by numerous factors, including:<br>
The person’s age, presence of various medical conditions and habits, level of fitness, and general
health (chronic tendon degeneration is more common with age).13 Poor fitness is theorized to make
physical injuries more common.<br>
The amount of forceful use and lack of recovery time (e.g., hours of work per day, per week, and per
month as well as number of breaks per day).<br>
The person’s genetics (e.g., a higher initial Type III/Type I collagen ratio in the tendons).<br>
Potential ergonomic risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders (i.e., excessive force,
awkward position, repetition, sustained exertion, vibration, improperly fitted tools or sports
equipment, or poor technique).<br>
<br>
<br>
VARYING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO TENDINOSES<br>
Individuals seem to vary in their susceptibility to tendinoses. Some people go through their entire lives
without ever experiencing tendinoses. Many people experience mild tendon problems, but recover. Others
develop chronic tendinosis that is not infrequently attributed to physical exertion. Many individuals develop
chronic tendon injuries in multiple places of the body. Usually, a careful medical history will reveal some
contributing associated factor(s), but tendon injury occasionally occurs without an obvious cause.<br>
Theoretically, the tendinosis cycle begins when breakdown exceeds repair. One theory is that physical exertion
causes micro-injuries that accumulate with time. The tensile strength of collagen is exceeded, and the tendon
tries to repair itself, but the cells produce new collagen with an abnormal structure and composition.<br>
The new collagen has an abnormally high Type III/Type I ratio. Experiments have shown that the excess
Type III collagen at the expense of Type I collagen weakens the tendon, making it prone to further injury.
Part of the problem may be that the new collagen fibers are less organized into the normal parallel structure,
making the tendon less able to withstand tensile stress along the direction of the tendon.<br>
Therefore, according to this theory, tendinosis is a slow accumulation of minor injuries that are not repaired
properly and that leave the tendon vulnerable to additional injury. This failed healing process may be one
reason that some people with tendinosis do not completely clinically heal following an injury, and thus
encounter difficulties in returning to their previous level of activity. Once the tendinosis cycle starts, the
tendon rarely heals back to its pre-injury state.<br>
Although relative rest is thought to be an essential part of the healing process for tendinosis, too much rest
causes deconditioning of muscles and tendons. Also, some individuals heal without any change in physical
activities. The weaker muscles and tendons leave the area more vulnerable to injury. Thus, the area may
become weaker on a large scale as well as on a cellular scale. This cycle of injury/rest/deconditioning/more
injury may be difficult to break. Gradual, careful physical exercises can help.<br>
<br>
<br>
INITIAL ASSESSMENT<br>
Thorough medical and work histories and a focused physical examination (see Chapter 2: General Approach
to Initial Assessment and Documentation) are recommended for the initial assessment of elbow symptoms.17
This evaluation should take into account the possibility that the elbow pain is referred from or due to a
disorder in another part of the body, particularly the neck, shoulder, or forearm. Red flags (see Table 1)
identified on the history and physical examination raise suspicion of serious elbow disorders.17 Their absence
generally rules out the need for special studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 weeks when spontaneous
improvement or recovery is expected. Referral may be needed when there is lack of training in managing the
specific entity, uncertainty about the diagnosis or treatment plan, or if red flags are present.<br>
<br>
Elbow disorders may be classified into one of four working categories (note, these categories are somewhat
arbitrary with significant overlap between the groups):<br>
Potentially serious elbow disorders: Fracture, acute dislocation, infection, or neurovascular compromise.
These disorders are usually associated with trauma.<br>
Mechanical disorders: Derangements of the elbow that are related to acute trauma, such as ligament
sprain or tears, contusions, or bursitis. Many musculoskeletal disorders are often categorized as
mechanical disorders, although there is evidence that these disorders may be associated with
degenerative changes.<br>
Degenerative disorders: Consequences of aging; medical conditions; or forceful, prolonged, or repeated
physical exertion; or a combination thereof. This category includes tendinoses.<br>
Non-specific disorders: Self-limiting disorders in the absence of objective physiological findings.
Non-specific disorders do not suggest necessarily internal derangement or referred pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
MEDICAL HISTORY<br>
The medical history is usually the most important aspect in the evaluation of a patient. Many disorders of the
elbow will be diagnosable with a high degree of accuracy prior to examination based upon a careful medical
history. Of critical importance in the occupational setting is the recording of the patient’s report of the mechanism(s)
of injury. It is noteworthy that this record is also often critical in subsequent case review. Asking the patient
open-ended questions, such as those that follow, allows the physician to gauge the need for further information.
Discussion, or more specific inquiries, will usually produce the detail necessary for clinical decision-making. It
may be helpful to also use standardized questionnaires such as the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder
and Hand) outcome measure or the Upper Extremity Function Scale for Upper Extremity Disorders.<br>

<br>
<br>
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION<br>
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination should include:<br>
General observation of the patient<br>
Focused examination of the forearm, arm, elbow, and shoulder with discussion of the symptoms<br>
Neurovascular assessment<br>
<br>
Though it may seem too obvious to warrant mention, the physician should specifically note which elbow
(left or right) is the subject of the patient’s complaints. Injured workers may have prior injuries to the opposite
elbow. Ambiguity in documentation can lead to a delay in acceptance of the patient’s workers’ compensation
claim, delay in the authorization of time-loss benefits, delay in the authorization of payment of medical care,
or even outright denial of the workers’ compensation claim.<br>
The physician should seek objective evidence including signs of pathology that are consistent with the patient’s
subjective complaints. In many cases, careful examination will reveal one or more truly objective findings, such
as swelling, deformity, atrophy, reflex changes, or spasm.<br>
<br>
Subjective Evidence: Symptoms<br>
Subjective symptoms are perceptible only to the patient. Examples of subjective findings include pain, tenderness
to palpation, numbness and tingling, pain-limited decreased range of motion, and weakness.<br>
<br>
Objective Evidence: Signs<br>
A sign is any objective evidence of a disease. Examples of objective evidence signs include visible changes,
swelling, deformity, redness, heat, reflex changes, spasm, palpable changes, atrophy, nonresistant passive
range of motion, and imaging findings. Such evidence is perceptible to the examining physician, as opposed
to the subjective sensations (symptoms) of the patient.<br>
Objective evidence should be thoroughly documented in the medical record both for reference during future
visits and for relevance to the patient’s workers’ compensation claim. For most patients with elbow disorders,
no truly objective physical examination evidence exists. Therefore, meticulous documentation of the patient’s
complaints at each visit is of the utmost importance in such cases.<br>
Accurate interpretation of physical examination findings requires the physician to be cognizant of the interplay
between the performance of many physical examination techniques and the patient’s responses. A number of
physical examination findings are actually a combination of objective and subjective evidence. Compliance
with the maneuver or a patient response is required for the interpretation of the results. Examples include
tenderness on palpation, reflexes, or ranges of motion or elicitation of pain with a maneuver (such as resisted
wrist extension inducing lateral or medial elbow pain).<br>
<br>
<br>
ANATOMY<br>
The elbow has four basic movements—flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. From a functional
perspective of the muscles, the physician may look at the elbow the following way based on the three main
groups of muscles/tendons:<br>
1. Those that attach to the lateral epicondyle or condyle—extend the wrist and supinate the elbow.<br>
2. Those that attach to the medial epicondyle or condyle—flex the wrist and pronate the elbow.<br>
3. Those that cross the elbow from the upper arm or shoulder—flex and extend the elbow and also
supinate and pronate, but do not insert into it (except for triceps into the olecranon).<br>
While there are many muscles and tendons associated with elbow and wrist movement, this chapter will only
address those that commonly cause elbow pain or produce referred pain to the elbow.<br>
<br>
Flexion of the elbow: The main flexors are the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis.17 The long head
of the biceps brachii originates on the supraglenoid tuberosity, while the short head originates on the coracoid
process and insertions are on the tuberosity of the radius and bicipital aponeurosis to the fascia of the forearm.
The brachialis muscle arises from the lower half of the anterior humerus and inserts on the tuberosity and coronoid
process of the ulna. The brachioradialis muscle originates on the lateral supracondylar ridge and inserts on the
radial styloid. Pertaining to the elbow, other than epicondylalgia, the biceps brachii are most often involved in
clinical tendinoses and ruptures.<br>
<br>
Extension of the elbow: Triceps muscle (long, medial, and lateral heads) are the main elbow extensors. They
originate from the infraglenoid tuberosity of the scapula, posterior aspect of the humerus and lateral aspect of the
humerus. They insert on the posterior and upper olecranon and fascia of the forearm. The anconeus originates
from the posterior aspect of the lateral epicondyle, inserts on the olecranon and upper posterior ulna, and is a minor
elbow extensor. Triceps tendinoses of the elbow occur, but are not clinically common in employed populations.<br>
<br>
Supination: The biceps is the main supinator. The supinator muscle also supinates the hand. The supinator
originates on the lateral epicondyle and ulna below the radial notch. It inserts on the radial tubercle and
oblique line of the radius.<br>
<br>
Pronation: Pronation is accomplished by the pronator teres and pronator quadratus. The pronator teres originates
above the medial epicondyle and medial side of the coronoid process of the ulna and inserts on the lateral
side of the radius. The pronator quadratus originates on the lower anterior shaft of the ulna and inserts on the
medial anterior surface of the distal radius.<br>
<br>
<br>
A. FOCUSED ELBOW EXAMINATION<br>
The physician should examine both elbows for comparison, and differences should be noted beginning with
careful observation. This should include inspection for visible changes, swelling, deformity, redness, heat,
spasm, and atrophy. Atrophy of the muscles of the ulnar or radial hand intrinsic muscles is an objective finding,
arising only after weeks to months of disuse or denervation. Deformities due to fractures are often subtle.
Dislocations may be associated with visible, objective abnormal findings. Signs of infection or inflammation
(redness, heat, swelling, tenderness, etc.) or gross tumor (palpable mass) may also be obvious.<br>
Next, active range of motion is assessed. If active range of motion is limited, then passive range of motion is
assessed to help determine if the limitation appears fixed, or rather painful, or otherwise limited. Movements
to evaluate limitation include elbow flexion and extension, forearm pronation and supination, wrist flexion,
extension, and ulnar and radial deviation. Limitation of motion or pain at the extremes of flexion or extension
suggests an intra-articular abnormality, or at least a joint-associated abnormality. An apparent loss of motion in
one elbow may be equally present in the non-affected limb, indicating either a congenital problem or voluntary
limitation of movement, which in either case would be unrelated to a unilateral injury.<br>
Particularly in the setting of trauma, tests for joint integrity are necessary. These tests include assessment for
instability of the elbow including the pivot shift test for posterolateral instability (lateral ulnar collateral ligament),
and valgus and varus tests.<br>
Palpation is performed on the elbow to ascertain points of tenderness. Palpation is also performed to detect
swelling, tumors, osteophytes, and other abnormalities. Individuals with lateral epicondylalgia tend to have tenderness over the epicondyle proper, the radial head, and/or two centimeters distant to the epicondyle.21
Similarly, those with medial epicondylalgia tend to have tenderness either over the epicondyle and/or several
centimeters distal.<br>
Muscle-strength testing is often helpful. However, weakness in the absence of atrophy is particularly difficult
to assess. Pain-limited weakness is common and makes determination of true muscular weakness substantially
more difficult. Weakness on the unaffected side should be noted.<br>
Reflexes help to detect abnormalities in nerves, nerve roots, spinal cord, and higher level functioning. Sensory
examination of the elbow includes fine touch, two-point discrimination, and vibratory sense and position sense
in the distal extremity. For the vast majority of common elbow problems, a full sensory examination is not
required. However, when symptoms that could represent a nervous system disorder are present, appropriate
examination is necessary.<br>
The physician should generally examine one joint above and below the joint being examined, particularly if
symptoms are present elsewhere. Thus, examination of the shoulder and forearm are required. Examination
of the neck is also required in many evaluations of the elbow to exclude cervical pathology as it is a common
source of patients’ elbow complaints.<br>
Special examination maneuvers are performed to help diagnose an elbow disorder.<br>
Common maneuvers include:<br>
Resisted wrist extension. Pain is produced in the lateral elbow in patients with lateral epicondylalgia.<br>
Resisted wrist flexion. Pain is produced in the medial elbow in those with medial epicondylalgia.<br>
Resisted middle finger extension. Pain is produced in the lateral elbow with resisted middle finger
extension. Some consider this sign more important in radial tunnel syndrome, but quality studies
documenting this do not exist and it is positive in many patients with lateral epicondylalgia.<br>
Resisted supination. This maneuver is positive for weakness in those with ruptures of the biceps
tendon, biceps tendinoses, musculocutaneous nerve, C5 or C6 nerve root problems. Patients with
lateral epicondylalgia and biceps tendinoses will tend to have pain with this maneuver.<br>
Resisted pronation. This maneuver demonstrates weakness in those with rupture of the pronator
origin from the medial epicondyle, and median nerve, C6 and C7 nerve root problems. Patients with
medial epicondylalgia will tend to have pain with this maneuver.<br>
Shaking hands sign. Patients with significant lateral epicondylalgia will tend to have reproduction of
their pain with a firm handshake. This test may also be positive with radial nerve entrapment.<br>
<br>
Another test used to diagnose elbow disorders is the Hoffman-Tinel’s test. However, it should be noted that
this test is increasingly thought to have low value in the diagnosis of any peripheral neuropathy.<br>
<br>
<br>
B. NEUROVASCULAR SCREENING<br>
Physicians should assess the neurological and vascular status of the elbow and distal upper extremity, especially
following dislocation, fractures, or other substantial trauma or if other symptoms suggest the need for this
evaluation. Evidence of problems with the median, ulnar, and radial nerve distributions should be sought.
Evaluation for evidence of cervical disc disease associated with radiculopathy that radiates to the elbow should
also be performed. C5 radiculopathy may result in weakness of elbow flexion, and T1 lesions may weaken the
hand intrinsic muscles in a manner that is similar to entrapment of the ulnar nerve. C6 radiculopathy can cause
lateral elbow pain, and as noted above, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lateral elbow pain.
Concomitant neck pain or stiffness, and/or thumb tingling can be helpful indications in that differential
analysis. Both left and right sides should be examined for consistency.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. ASSESSING RED FLAGS<br>
Physical examination evidence of neurovascular compromise, fracture, unreduced dislocation, infection,
or tumor that correlates with the medical history and with test results may indicate a need for immediate
consultation. The examination may further reinforce or reduce suspicion of these diagnoses.<br>
<br>
<br>
D. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES<br>
Elbow disorders, as described by the patient, can sometimes be consistent with radiating symptoms from the
neck or shoulder, and the examining physician’s diagnostic acumen is important in determining the source.
For example, mid-upper-arm pain on arm elevation is most likely related to a problem originating in the
shoulder area, not the elbow, although patients may have pain in both areas. It is important to note that lateral
elbow pain can be due to cervical disc disease (C6), radial nerve entrapment (including radial tunnel syndrome),
synovitis due to degeneration, or true epicondylitis (enthesitis). A complaint of tingling and/or numbness in
the fourth and fifth fingers is usually due to ulnar nerve impingement at the elbow, C8 cervical radiculopathy,
or impingement of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. Thoracic outlet syndrome can be considered, although that
condition is generally believed to be quite uncommon. For the differential diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia,
C6 radiculopathy is believed to be the most common alternate diagnosis and not infrequently presents with
lateral elbow pain and paresthesias in the thumb. The differential diagnosis of medial epicondylalgia similarly
includes C8 radiculopathy presenting as medial elbow pain and paresthesias in the fourth and fifth digits.
Medial collateral ligament problems may also present with medial elbow pain. Concomitant existence of
medial epicondylalgia with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow frequently occurs. In cases of complaints that
cannot be classified as a specific pathophysiological condition, a diagnosis of non-specific pain should be
used. This is far preferable to specific labeling, which may not be accurate. Non-specific or regional pain will
more frequently be the most appropriate diagnosis if there are no specific physical findings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA<br>
If the patient does not have red flags for serious conditions, the physician can then determine which common
musculoskeletal elbow disorder is most likely present. The criteria presented in Table 2 follow the clinical
thought process, from the mechanism of illness or injury, to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder, and finally to diagnostic investigation, if needed, to guide treatment at this stage.<br>
1. For each diagnosis, signs, as well as symptoms, are required to fulfill the diagnostic criteria. It is
also important to understand the rate of false positives and false negatives for various tests used
to confirm the diagnosis.<br>

<br>
WORK-RELATEDNESS<br>
Symptoms associated with physical tasks commonly involve elbow disorders. A thorough understanding
of the work history and patient work and non-work activities can help to determine work-relatedness
(see Chapter 2: General Approach to Initial Assessment and Documentation, and Chapter 4: Work-Relatedness,
for additional details).<br>
Tendinoses, epicondylalgia, epicondylitis, and olecranon bursitis are sometimes attributed to employment activities.
Such a conclusion requires a careful history regarding occupational physical factors, non-work activities,
individual or personal factors, and psychosocial, psychiatric, and other risk factors, as well as a thoughtful,
careful assessment of the relative contribution each makes to the patient’s problem while incorporating
epidemiological evidence. However, many conditions have no apparent cause and thus are defined as idiopathic.<br>
Physical factors are currently thought to contribute to regional elbow pain and perhaps epicondylalgia/
epicondylitis, although the evidence is not particularly strong.2,14 For example, few prospective cohort studies
have been reported. In addition, the strength of the association in the reported studies is not great. Current
evidence suggests that force, repetition, and duration of exertion may be the most important physical factors
contributing to elbow pain.<br>
Quality occupational epidemiological studies on the etiology of ulnar and radial neuropathies have not been
reported, thus causation of those disorders is speculative. There are multiple theories of causation for these
disorders. Olecranon bursitis can be associated with work-related trauma. This condition is thought to arise
from either acute trauma to the olecranon bursa or unaccustomed pressure to the bursa.<br>
<br>
<br>
INITIAL CARE
Comfort is often a patient’s primary concern. Nonprescription analgesics will provide sufficient pain relief for
most patients with acute and subacute elbow symptoms. If the patient’s response to treatment is inadequate
(i.e., his or her symptoms and activity limitations continue), pharmaceuticals, orthotics, or physical methods
can be prescribed. Co-morbid conditions, side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences should guide
the health care professional’s choice of recommendations.<br>
The following are treatment recommendations for contusion, olecranon bursitis (aseptic), nondisplaced radial
head fracture, dislocation of the elbow, sprain of the elbow, biceps tendinosis, ulnar nerve entrapment, radial
nerve entrapment, pronator syndrome, lateral epicondylalgia, and medial epicondylalgia. These treatment
modalities may be administered or supervised by a number of health care professionals, including physicians,
nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, etc., according to
their legal scope of practice. It should be noted that for treatments of uncertain effectiveness that are free of
undue risk and individual and aggregate cost, a therapeutic trial may be appropriate if side effects and
effectiveness are carefully followed. The effectiveness of such a trial should be measured by objective findings
appropriate for the patient and the intervention, and should be documented accordingly. The trial should be
promptly discontinued if it does not result in subjective or functional improvement.<br>
Referral is indicated in cases where the health care provider has a lack of training in managing the specific
entity, is uncertain about the diagnosis or treatment plan, or red flags are present. If significant symptoms
causing self-limitations or restrictions persist beyond 4–6 weeks, referral for specialty evaluation (e.g., occupational
medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or orthopaedic surgery) may be indicated to assist in the confirmation
of the provisional diagnosis and to define further clinical management.<br>
<br>
<br>
CONTUSION<br>
A contusion is an injury of a part without a break in the skin and with a subcutaneous hemorrhage. It is an
acute injury with bruising.11 Medical management of contusions should be directed at maintaining normal
elbow function. With significant contusion-related injury, there is a risk of deep tissue involvement, potentially
leading to scarring and limitation of motion. Accordingly, treatment should include anti-inflammatory
medications with avoidance of immobilization except as necessitated by other injuries. Anti-inflammatory
medications serve as an analgesic in the doses that are used for contusions. Early mobilization should also
be encouraged to prevent impairment and disability and can be best accomplished through instruction in the
initial clinical visit. Medical management can be summarized as protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation,
and range-of-motion exercises. Range-of-motion exercises should primarily involve the elbow, but may also
include the shoulder and wrist, particularly if a sling is prescribed. Quality studies are not available on the
benefits of these treatment options and there is not evidence of their benefits. However, these options are low
cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence as to the benefits of
these options, they are recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
OLECRANON BURSITIS (ASEPTIC)<br>
Olecranon bursitis is a condition associated with a generally painless effusion of the olecranon bursa, frequently
caused by either overt or seemingly insignificant trauma over the olecranon. In a minority of cases, it may
become infected, at which point pain and tenderness predominate. Quality studies are not available on the
following treatment options for olecranon bursitis, and as such, there is not evidence of benefits. However,
these options are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence,
the following treatment options are recommended:<br>
Soft padding of the elbow which appears successful for most cases [Recommended, Insufficient
Evidence (I)]; and<br>
Modifying activities to avoid direct pressure over the olecranon and allowing time to reabsorb the
fluid [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
Glucocorticoid injection into an uninfected bursa is not recommended for initial management as it may
introduce an infection and necessitate surgery; however, it is sometimes used for bursitis that is resistant to
other treatment. Therefore, injection of a glucocorticosteroid 3 or more weeks later is neither recommended
nor not recommended [No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)]. (See the surgical section for surgical
issues, as well as for septic olecranon bursitis.)<br>
<br>
NON-DISPLACED RADIAL HEAD FRACTURE<br>
Radial head fractures typically occur from falls onto an outstretched hand. If the fracture is large and displaced
or comminuted (Type III) or there is a large fracture with a displaced fragment (Type II), surgical referral is
indicated. An x-ray is required to determine the degree of the fracture and type of treatment required. For the
medical management of non-displaced radial head fracture, the physician should prescribe a sling or splint
for 7 days. (A shorter complete immobilization period of as little as 3 days may be used for non-displaced
fractures that are clinically present but not visible on an x-ray.) After 7 days, gentle range-of-motion exercises
within pain tolerance should begin,17 followed by progressive mobilization. Range-of-motion exercises should
primarily involve the elbow, but should also include the shoulder (to prevent frozen shoulder), and the wrist.
Limited mobility may be achieved with a sling, cast, or posterior elbow splint wrapped over the joint with a
tensor at 90° flexion. A thermoplastic splint with Velcro straps may also be used. As pain diminishes, the unresistant active movement should be increased to pain tolerance to prevent or minimize contracture.
Quality studies are not available on these treatment options and there is not evidence of their benefits.
However, these options are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient
evidence as to the benefits of these options, they are recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW<br>
Dislocation of the elbow generally occurs as a result of significant, high-force trauma, and only dislocation of
the shoulder is more common clinically.17 The most common mechanism is falling onto an outstretched hand,
resulting in a posterior dislocation (98% of cases). Severe pain and inability to use the elbow and hand are
typical presenting complaints. Accompanying fractures and vascular and neurological problems are common.
Radial head fractures are present approximately 10% of the time.<br>
There are no quality studies for treating dislocation of the elbow. An evaluation of the motor, sensory, and
vascular system is required. Medical management of the dislocated elbow should include an x-ray to assure
that there is no fracture. If the elbow remains dislocated, it should be reduced by a health care professional
experienced in joint relocation as soon as possible. Injection of an anesthetic into the swollen joint space may
help. The longer the elbow remains dislocated, the higher the probability that general anesthesia will be
required to successfully reduce the elbow. Post-reduction x-rays are necessary, as well as an examination to be
sure that the reduction is successful and that there is no loose body present. A posterior splint is to be applied
for 10 days. Range-of-motion exercises are recommended after immobilization. Range-of-motion exercises
should primarily involve the elbow, but should also include the shoulder (to prevent frozen shoulder), and
the wrist. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful. Quality studies are not available on
these treatment options for dislocation of the elbow, and there is not evidence of benefits due to the relatively
low incidence combined with the acute traumatic nature of these cases. However, these options are low cost,
have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence as to their benefits, these
options are recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
SPRAIN OF THE ELBOW<br>
An isolated elbow sprain is relatively uncommon and is caused by a significant high-force trauma, resulting
in a disruption of ligament(s) about the elbow. The most common mechanism is a fall. Generally, a sprain is
accompanied by other problems such as fracture, dislocation, or contusion. These potential complications
need to be evaluated including the motor, sensory, and vascular systems. For the medical management of
dislocation of the elbow, an x-ray should be taken to assure that there is no fracture.<br>
Pain and limited use of the elbow are typical presenting complaints. There are no quality studies on treating
sprains of the elbow. A shoulder sling may be used for up to 1 week. Gentle range-of-motion exercises are
recommended to be initiated at the first visit to prevent complications from immobilization, particularly if a
sling is prescribed. While range-of-motion exercises should concentrate on the elbow, they should include the
shoulder joint to prevent frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) and the wrist as well. NSAIDs are helpful.
Quality studies are not available on these treatment options and there is not evidence of their benefits due to
the relatively low incidence. However, these options are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive.
Thus, while there is insufficient evidence supporting their use, these options are recommended
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
BICEPS TENDINOSIS<br>
Biceps tendinosis is a true muscle strain involving the muscle-tendon junction of the biceps brachii. It typically
occurs in the setting of the use of high force, particularly if unaccustomed. Symptoms are non-radiating pain
in the muscle-tendon junction and there are generally no paraesthesias. Pain limited weakness is a common
complaint. In severe cases, the muscle is ruptured and in many working age patients, usually requires surgical
repair (see Surgical Considerations).<br>
NSAIDs are helpful. Activity limitations to avoid aggravating exposures are recommended. A sling may be
helpful for severe cases, but gentle range-of-motion exercises should be prescribed to avoid contraction. While
range-of-motion exercises should concentrate on the elbow, they should include the shoulder joint to prevent
frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) and the wrist as well. Therapy with transitioning to strengthening
exercises is recommended. Quality studies are not available on treatment options for biceps tendinosis and
there is not evidence of benefits due to the low incidence. However, these options are low cost, have few side
effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence, they are recommended
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT (including Cubital Tunnel Syndrome)<br>
Although it is possible to entrap a nerve at any point along its course, there are two main areas for entrapment
of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The first is in the condylar groove, and the second begins immediately distal
to the elbow joint in the true, anatomic cubital tunnel. This tunnel commences as the ulnar nerve begins to
traverse distally beneath the aponeurosis. Most of the published literature does not distinguish between these
types of ulnar neuropathy despite the improbability that the risk factors and treatments are the same. This
produces a substantial lack of clarity in the available evidence.<br>
Proper testing to localize the abnormality involves a nerve conduction study that includes at least stimulation above
and below the elbow.24 The role for the “inching technique” to isolate the location of the nerve conduction velocity
decrement and infer the precise location of the entrapment, while logical, has not been defined in the evidence.<br>
Aside from surgical studies, there are no quality studies on which to rely for treatment of ulnar neuropathies,
and there is not evidence of benefits of the following treatment options. However, these options are low cost,
have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence, these treatment options
are recommended:<br>
Elbow padding [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)];<br>
Avoidance of leaning on the ulnar nerve at the elbow [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)];<br>
Avoidance of prolonged hyperflexion of the elbow [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)]; and<br>
Although not particularly successful for neuropathic pain, utilization of NSAIDs [Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT (including Radial Tunnel Syndrome)<br>
Radial nerve entrapment, particularly of the posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve, causes proximal
forearm aching and pain that persists despite presumably effective treatment. It is clinically somewhat difficult
to distinguish from non-specific forearm and elbow pain, and it is sometimes referred to as “resistant tennis elbow” or “supinator syndrome.” A relatively rare condition, radial nerve entrapment is estimated to be
approximately 30–100 fold less common than carpal tunnel syndrome.25 There are multiple sites for potential
entrapment. Most commonly, these sites include the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin, fibrous bands overlying
the radial head, radial recurrent arterial fan, and the arcade of Frohse at the entrance to the supinator muscle.<br>
A confirmatory electrodiagnostic motor study is helpful, but often difficult to obtain [Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)]. There are no quality studies on which to rely for the treatment of radial
neuropathies and there is not evidence of benefits of the following treatment options. However, these options
are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence to support
their use, they are recommended:<br>
Use of a wrist splint for periodic daytime use rather than continuous use
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)]; and<br>
Although not particularly successful for neuropathic pain, utilization of NSAIDs
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
PRONATOR SYNDROME<br>
Pronator syndrome involves median nerve entrapment under or within the pronator teres muscle in the
proximal forearm. It causes pain in the flexor forearm and paresthesias similar to carpal tunnel syndrome,
which is the main consideration in the differential diagnosis. Pronator syndrome is believed to cause
nocturnal awakening less frequently than carpal tunnel syndrome. A confirmatory electrodiagnostic study
is helpful, but somewhat difficult to obtain [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)]. There are no quality
studies on which to rely for the treatment of pronator syndrome and there is not evidence of benefits of the
following treatment options. However, these options are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive.
Thus, while there is insufficient evidence, the following options are recommended:<br>
Wrist brace [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)];<br>
Although not particularly successful for neuropathic pain, utilization of NSAIDs
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)]; and<br>
Activity modifications should be attempted if felt to be contributory
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
LATERAL EPICONDYLALGIA (Lateral Epicondylitis)<br>
Lateral epicondylalgia (lateral epicondylitis) causes soreness, or pain on the outside (lateral) side of the upper
arm near the elbow. There may be a partial tear of the tendon fibers, which connect muscle to bone, at or near
their point of origin on the outside of the elbow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INITIAL CARE<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s primary concern. In employment settings, where milder cases are more frequently
seen, nonprescription analgesics may provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute
elbow symptoms. Patients in clinical settings may be more severe and may require prescription analgesics as
first line treatments. If the treatment response is inadequate, such that symptoms and activity limitations
continue, prescribed pharmaceuticals, orthotics, or physical methods can be added. Comorbid conditions,
side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences should guide the health care professional’s choice of
recommendations. Table 3 summarizes options for lateral epicondylalgia. Conservative care often consists of
activity modification using epicondylalgia supports (tennis elbow bands), and NSAIDs with standard precautions
on potential side effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Table 3. Methods of Symptom Control for Lateral Epicondylalgia<br>
RECOMMENDED<br>
Nonprescription Medications: Acetaminophen—safest and may be effective when taken regularly (I), Aspirin (I), Ibuprofen (B)<br>
Prescribed Pharmaceutical Medications: Oral NSAIDs (B), Topical NSAIDs (B), Local corticosteroid injection—1 mL triamcinolone (10 mg.mL) of bupivacaine with a 25 or 27 gauge needle—for short-term benefit after 3–4 weeks of conservative treatment (B)<br>
Physical Rehabilitation Interventions: Adjustment or modification of workstation, job tasks, job rotation, breaks, or work hours and methods, if needed (I), Specific elbow exercises for range of motion and, if needed, strengthening (I), Aerobic exercise to maintain general conditioning (I), Initial and follow-up visits for education, counseling, and evaluation of home exercise (I), At-home local applications of cold packs during first few days of acute symptoms; thereafter application of heat packs, or cold packs as the patient prefers (I), Note: It is not believed to be useful to simultaneously treat a patient with more than 2–3 modalities.<br>
Physical Modalities: Tennis elbow band (I), Ultrasound treatment—pulsed ratio of 1:4 and duration of 2 ms or continuous—at a frequency of 0.7–1.5 MHz, an intensity of 1.0–2.0 W/cm2, for 5–10 minutes, over a 5 cm2 treatment area, 2–3 times per week based on objective results up to 5–6 weeks (B), Iontophoresis—40mA-minutes, total of 6–10 treatments, with either glucocorticoid or diclofenac (C), Acupuncture (I)<br>
<br>
<br>
MEDICATIONS<br>
<br>
Acetaminophen: There is no evidence evaluating the effects of acetaminophen in treating epicondylalgia.
However, acetaminophen may provide enough mild analgesic relief to allow the patient to exercise or function
at a higher level. Quality studies are not available on acetaminophen, and there is not evidence of its treatment
benefits. However, it is low cost, has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence,
acetaminophen is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Oral NSAIDs: One intermediate-quality study (patients with symptoms of 10 or less days) was reviewed that
randomized flurbiprofen vs. piroxicam28 and found that “flurbiprofen was significantly superior to piroxicam
with regard to relief of pain at day 28, pain on active movement at days 14 and 28, pain on passive movement at
days 7, 14 and 28 and pain, as measured by a visual analogue scale, at day 14.” Two low-quality studies evaluated
diflunisal and naproxen. The first found no significant differences between the groups (patients with symptoms
for at least 6 or 7 days prior to evaluation) and therefore, concluded that diflunisal and naproxen are “equivalent
in providing relief of pain and tenderness due to tennis elbow.”29 The second study (patients’ duration of symptoms
not indicated) concluded that “diflunisal and naproxen significantly reduce pain…however, diflunisal provided
more effective pain relief in the group studied.”30 Lastly, one high-quality study (43.3% of patients had symptoms
for less than 6 weeks and 44.1% had symptoms for more than 6 months) evaluated diclofenac (150 mg) versus
placebo, with the results indicating that a “statistically and clinically significant reduction of pain was associated
with diclofenac, but no clinically significant difference in grip strength or functional improvement could be
detected between the 2 groups.”31 The authors concluded that it is “difficult to recommend the use of diclofenac
in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia at the dosage used in this study.”<br>
In conclusion, there is some evidence that NSAIDs result in improvements. There also is some weak,
preliminary evidence suggesting that all NSAIDs may not be equally efficacious for lateral epicondylalgia.
Evidence suggests that piroxicam is inferior to other NSAIDs for the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia, and
thus should not be either the first- or second-line treatment. Quality studies are available on NSAIDs including
acute (less than 1 month), subacute (1-3 months), and chronic (more than 3 months) lateral epicondylalgia
patients and there is evidence of its benefits. Effects are dose dependent and caution should be used with
higher doses primarily due to gastrointestinal side effects. Overall, these options are low cost, have few side
effects, and are not invasive. Thus, NSAIDs are recommended as a treatment option [Moderately
Recommended, Evidence (B)].<br>
<br>
Aspirin: There is no evidence evaluating the effects of aspirin in treating epicondylalgia. However, aspirin
may provide enough mild analgesic relief to allow a patient to exercise or function at a higher level. Quality
studies are not available on aspirin and there is not evidence of its benefits. However, this option is low cost,
has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence supporting its use, aspirin
is recommended as a treatment option [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Topical NSAIDs and Other Agents: One intermediate-quality study was reviewed that reported on a
flurbiprofen local-action transcutaneous (LAT) patch versus piroxicam gel (patients’ duration of symptoms
not indicated). Results found that “flurbiprofen LAT had a greater efficacy than piroxicam gel, and was also
preferred by patients in the treatment of painful soft-tissue rheumatism of the shoulder and elbow.”32 An
intermediate-quality study (patients’ duration of symptoms not indicated) examined transdermal electromotive
drug administration of ketorolac vs. placebo (normal saline) and found that “poor results (no improvement)
were significantly higher in the placebo-treated group, while good results were significantly higher in the
ketorolac-treated group.”33 Another intermediate-quality study (patients’ duration of symptoms not indicated)
examined the effectiveness of naproxen applied by topical iontophoresis or by phonophoresis and found that
“iontophoresis and phonophoresis of naproxen are equally effective electrotherapy methods in the treatment
of lateral epicondylitis.”<br>
Two intermediate-quality studies examined topical use of diclofenac for lateral epicondylalgia. One study
(patients with symptom duration of 2 months; average of 8.3 months) found that “topical 2% diclofenac in
pluronic lecithin liposomal organo-gel (PLO) appears to provide effective short-term reduction in elbow pain
and wrist extensor weakness associated with chronic lateral epicondylitis.”35 The second study (patients with
onset of symptoms less than 4 weeks) concluded that there was a “statistically significant gradually increasing
clinical improvement in patients treated with diclofenac gel as compared with the control group, as well as
good tolerability of the drug in the treatment of soft-tissue rheumatism.”36 A low-quality study (duration of
injury was no more than 5 days for sprains and no more than 12 days for tendinitis) compared piroxicam gel
and diclofenac topical gel in the treatment of acute sprains and tendinitis of the ankle, shoulder, or elbow and
found “no difference in the response to treatment or in the global impressions of efficacy between piroxicam
and diclofenac.”37 Therefore, the authors concluded that “piroxicam 0.5% gel and diclofenac 1.16% gel are
equally effective and well tolerated in the treatment of selected acute sprains and tendinitis.” Lastly, an
intermediate-quality study evaluated diclofenac epolamine (DHEP) lecithin gel versus placebo gel (patients
pain had been present for less than 5 days).38 The results indicated that “DHEP lecithin gel is a topically
effective analgesic product in patients with shoulder periarthritis or lateral epicondylitis and provide further
evidence on the use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an optimal approach to the treatment
of localized musculoskeletal disorders.” There are no studies evaluating other agents, including ketamine gel.
Several studies that were reviewed that compared either two topical NSAIDs or a topical NSAID and a placebo
showed that there is some evidence of improvement when using topical NSAIDs for the treatment of lateral
epicondylalgia. Evidence suggests that piroxicam is inferior to other NSAIDs for the treatment of lateral
epicondylalgia, and thus should not be either a first- or second-line treatment. There are no studies comparing
topical agents with oral NSAIDs. Quality studies are available on topical NSAIDs including acute, subacute
and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients and there is evidence of benefits. This option is low cost, has few
side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, topical NSAIDs are recommended as a treatment option [Moderately
Recommended, Evidence (B)].<br>
<br>
Narcotics: There are no quality studies evaluating opioids in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. Opioids
cause significant side effects, which include poor patient tolerance, constipation, drowsiness, clouded judgment,
memory loss, and potential misuse or dependence has been reported in up to 35% of patients. Patients should
be informed of these potential side effects and cautioned against operating motor vehicles or machinery before
prescribing opioids. Opioids do not appear to be more effective than safer analgesics for managing most
musculoskeletal symptoms; they should be used only if needed for severe pain and only for a short time. Opioids
in an acute elbow injury or inflammation with redness, heat and swelling, may be used concurrently with an
anti-inflammatory, ice, and rest and tapered off after 2 to 3 days. In a subacute or chronic situation, they are
limited to concurrent use with an exercise program and then tapered off over several days to 2 weeks, as
strength and endurance improve. No use beyond this time is recommended regardless of the outcome. Quality
studies are not available on narcotics and there is not evidence of their benefits. This option is low cost, is not
invasive, but has many significant side effects. Thus, narcotics are not recommended [Not Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)] except as outlined above.<br>

INJECTIONS<br>
<br>
Corticosteroid injections: Twelve articles on corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylalgia were reviewed,
including 10 studies9,10,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46 and two meta-analysis.47,48 One of the studies was of high quality, seven of
intermediate quality, and two of low quality. Evidence consistently demonstrates that steroid injections into the
vicinity of the lateral epicondyle produce short-term pain relief more effectively than do either physical therapy
or a “wait and see” approach. However, in the long term, steroid injections are less effective in providing pain relief
than is physical therapy or a “wait and see” approach.9,10,47,48 One study compared a “wait and see” approach (one
visit with a family doctor during which the patients were encouraged “to await further spontaneous improvement”
and possible recommendation for the use of acetaminophen or an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication)
with corticosteroid injections (into “every tender spot…until the patient was free of pain during resisted
dorsiflexion”) and physical therapy (9 treatments of pulsed ultrasound, deep friction massage and an exercise
program) over a 6 week intervention period.9 The patients included in this study had pain for at least 6 weeks
duration with a median duration of 11 weeks in the three groups. Initially, steroid injections were the most
successful form of treatment. By 12 weeks, however, the success rates of “wait and see” and physical therapy
exceeded those of steroid injections. There was no statistically significant benefit of physical therapy over
“wait and see.” Another study (patients with symptoms for less than 4 weeks) compared the addition of
steroid injections in the vicinity of the lateral epicondyle to similarly performed sham injections, in randomly
selected groups of patients receiving rehabilitation treatment.43 There was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Both groups had a nearly significant
(p=0.06) improvement in the mean from baseline to 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months for all 5 pain scales. From
8 weeks to 6 months, there was a significant improvement in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores for the
group receiving the corticosteroid injections (p = 0.04), but not in the group receiving the sham injections.<br>
This intervention was assessed in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients. Overall, the
studies show clear short-term benefits, yet high recurrence rates among injection groups. The level of pain
several weeks after injection generally approaches that of the natural history of resolution of the disorder; thus
injections (e.g., 1 mL triamcinolone [10 mg/mL] with a 25 or 27 gauge needle) are recommended for short
term benefit to reduce the overall magnitude of pain in select cases. In most cases, physicians should carry
out conservative measures (i.e., NSAIDs, orthotics, other non-interventional measures) for 4–6 weeks before
considering injections. Generally, there is an inclination to not use more than approximately 3 glucocorticoid
injections in any one location for one episode. However, there is no evidence that there is or is not a limit on
the number of injections either for an episode or for a lifetime. Subsequent injections should be supported by
either objective improvement or utilization of a different technique or location for the injection(s). If symptom
relief is obtained, then a proven graduated exercise program for strength and endurance should be considered
to maintain and enhance that improvement. It should be noted that glucocorticoid injections have some risks.
For example, with a large volume in a small space there is a risk of tendon fraying and even rupture,
although the underlying pathogenesis is thought to frequently entail those processes. Injections can also cause
an inflammatory reaction causing pain lasting for several hours, and rarely infection.<br>
There is good evidence that glucocorticoid injections reduce lateral epicondylar pain. However, there is also
good evidence that the recurrence rates are high. On the other hand, pain at the time of recurrence is generally
not as severe. Thus, despite the problems with recurrence, there is support for utilizing corticosteroid injections
in select cases to help decrease overall pain problems during the disorders’ natural recovery or improvement
phase. Quality studies are available on glucocorticoid injections and there is evidence of short-term benefits,
but not long-term benefits. This option is invasive, but is low cost and has few side effects. Thus, if a
non-invasive treatment strategy fails to improve the condition over a period of at least 3–4 weeks, glucocorticoid
injections are recommended [Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)].<br>
One study used corticosteroid injections combined with either lidocaine or bupivacaine (average symptom
duration was 7.9 months in one group and 9.1 months in the other group). The author concluded that the “outcome
at 2 weeks was significantly better with bupivacaine for patients who had not been treated previously in any way
and for those with short histories of epicondylalgia, defined as symptom duration no longer than 3 months.”46
Quality studies are available on the use of bupivacaine as an adjuvant for glucocorticoid injections, and there
is some evidence of short-term benefits that are superior to lidocaine. This option is invasive, but is low cost
and has few side effects. Thus, bupivacaine, as an adjuvant for glucocorticoid injections, is recommended
[Recommended, Evidence (C)].<br>
<br>
Botulinum injections: Botulinum injections were evaluated for treatment of lateral epicondylalgia in three
studies, one of intermediate quality and two of high quality. An industry-sponsored, multicenter double-blind,
randomized-controlled clinical trial of botulinum A versus placebo for treatment of epicondylalgia lasting at
least 4 months and failing at least three other interventions found both groups improved significantly over
the 4-month follow-up period.49 There was no difference at any point in the maximum pain scores, but other
pain measures were different. At week 18, the pain score (composed of 5 different physical examination
maneuvers) had fallen in the botulinum group from 8.4±0.2 to 2.9±0.4 while the controls dropped from
8.6±0.2 to 4.3±0.4 (p = 0.009). Another study evaluated 60 patients who had pain for at least 3 months (30
received a botulinum toxin injection and 30 received a placebo) and found that “botulinum toxin injection
may improve pain over a 3-month period in some patients with lateral epicondylitis, but injections may be
associated with digit paresis and weakness of finger extension.”50 However, a study which evaluated 40
patients with symptoms for more than 6 months (19 received botulinum toxin injection and 21 received normal
saline solution) did not find a significant difference between the two groups studied and therefore, no evidence
of benefit from botulinum toxin injection was found.51 Quality studies of chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients
are available on botulinum injections, but the available studies conflict on whether these injections are beneficial.
This option is invasive, has side effects, and is high cost. Thus, there is no recommendation for botulinum
injections [No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Autologous blood injections: There are no quality studies of autologous blood injections for lateral epicondylalgia.
Quality studies are not available on autologous blood injections and there is not evidence of its benefits. This
option while low cost, is invasive and has side effects. Thus, autologous blood injections are not recommended
[Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
<br>
PHYSICAL METHODS<br>
<br>
There are a variety of physical methods which may be appropriate to use in the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia.
However, as reviewed below, there is evidence of efficacy for certain methods, no evidence for several others,
and evidence of a lack of efficacy for some. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to provide
better evidence for the use of many physical interventions that are commonly employed. Some providers use
a variety of procedures; yet conclusions regarding their effectiveness are not based on high-quality studies.
Included among these interventions are epicondylalgia supports, exercise, heat/cold packs, manipulation,
massage, friction massage, soft tissue mobilization, biofeedback, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation
(TENS), electrical stimulation (E-STIM), magnets, diathermy, and acupuncture.<br>
The therapist should document objective evidence of functional improvement in order to justify continued
care. This can be demonstrated by a combination of clinical improvement in disability questionnaires (e.g.,
DASH or Upper Extremity Function Scale), improvement in pain-free grip strength, or improvement in lifting
ability, or some other functional activity (i.e., the therapist should be evaluating the patient’s performance of
an activity found to be limited at the time of the initial evaluation). Instead of focusing on a specific number
of visits/treatment duration, identifying trends in the treatment provided are likely to be more helpful:<br>
The visit frequency should decrease over the episode of care, with the patient performing exercises
more independently and the therapist’s role becoming more consultative and coaching, assisting in
progression of exercise and encouraging the patient.<br>
The use of physical agents and manual procedures should be weaned from supervised treatment
either entirely, or limited to home use.<br>
It is reasonable to expect that if a particular treatment is going to benefit a particular patient, beneficial
effects should be evident within 2–3 visits. Continuing with a treatment that has not resulted in objective
improvement is not reasonable. Treatment that has not resulted in improvement after a couple of visits
should either be modified substantially or discontinued.<br>
It should be expected that most patients with more severe conditions receive 8–12 visits over 6–8
weeks, as long as functional improvement and program progression are documented. Patients with
mild symptoms may require either no therapy appointments or only a few appointments. Those with
moderate problems may require 5–6 visits.<br>
<br>
PHYSICAL TREATMENT METHODS AVAILABLE INCLUDE:<br>
<br>
Epicondylalgia Supports (Tennis Elbow Bands, Braces or Epicondylitis Straps): Eleven articles were
reviewed on orthotics for epicondylalgia, five studies52,53,54,55,56 and six meta analysis.57,58,59,60,61,62 Three of the
studies were of intermediate quality and two were of low quality. One study examined a sample of 63
patients with symptoms for 6 weeks or longer in which 30 received treatment with the dynamic extensor
brace and 33 received no brace for 12 weeks (there was a crossover period from weeks 12–24, where
the no brace group received treatment with the brace).53 The results of the study showed that “12 weeks
of brace treatment results in relief of pain, improvement in functionality of the arm, and pain-free grip
strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The beneficial effects last for at least another 12 weeks
after cessation of the brace therapy.” Another study evaluated 180 patients (with symptoms for at least
6 weeks) treating them with either physical therapy (n = 56), an Epipoint brace (n = 68) or combination
of physical therapy and brace treatment (n = 56).54 As the physical therapy regimen was not specified,
the results are uninterpretable. The authors concluded that “brace treatment might be useful as initial
therapy. Combination therapy has no additional advantage compared to physical therapy but is superior
to brace only for the short term [6 weeks].” Quality studies are available on epicondylalgia supports
in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients, although the braces most commonly
used in research studies are not widely used in the US. There is evidence of benefits. However, these
options are low cost, have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence
to support their use, they are recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Instruction in home exercise. Eleven articles were reviewed, eight studies9,10,43,54,63,64,65,66 and three
meta-analysis,47,48,62 none of which had a control group, some had small numbers of subjects and none
had an isolated experimental group of exercise only. Comparisons of exercise techniques used across
studies are difficult and limit interpretation. Co-interventions were very common, further limiting
interpretation. One study was high quality, six were intermediate and one was low quality. One of the
reviews evaluated 28 studies and suggested that exercise may improve pain, but not grip strength, in
lateral epicondylalgia. Except for cases of unstable fractures or acute dislocations, it is recommended
that physicians advise patients to do early range-of-motion exercises at home. Range-of-motion
exercises should primarily involve the elbow, but should also include the shoulder and the wrist.
Instruction in proper exercise technique is important, and a few visits to a physical therapist can serve
to educate the patient about an effective exercise program. Quality studies are available on exercise
programs in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients, although there are many
differences between the exercise programs used in research studies and thus comparisons between
studies are difficult. There is not good evidence for any one specific exercise strategy. Benefits have
not been clearly shown. However, these options are low cost (as single time instructions), have few
side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence, instruction in home
exercise is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)]. In the event that the patient is
either incapable of performing home exercises, or otherwise unable to comply with this option, then
a supervised program with a therapist is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Heat or Cold Packs. One study of intermediate quality of subacute and chronic lateral epicondylalgia
patients was reviewed. It included 40 patients with symptoms for at least 4 weeks (duration of
symptoms was approximately 4 months in the group studied). The study provided evidence that the
application of ice following exercise does not improve pain relief over exercise alone.67 Only one quality
study is available on cryotherapy and none on heat. Benefits have not been shown. These options are
low cost (as at-home applications), have few side effects, and are not invasive. Thus, while there is
insufficient evidence, at-home applications of heat or cold packs are recommended [Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Iontophoresis. Three studies were reviewed, all of intermediate quality. One study was a device
manufacturer-funded study that included 199 patients with symptoms of 3 months or less.68 There
appeared to be an initial improvement in symptoms with iontophoresis. However, it was not sustained
by the 1 month follow-up. One study evaluated 64 patients with pain for at least 1 month, but had a
33% dropout rate.69 There were no statistically significant differences between the iontophoresis
steroid group and the iontophoresis placebo group. All subjects (experimental and control) improved
with time. The last study included 40 patients (mean duration of pain was 5.2 months in one group
and 4.8 months in the second group), was nonblinded with no placebo group, and performed in
Turkey with equipment not available in the US.70 The results from this study “suggest some benefits
from the process of iontophoresis and the use of infrared in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and
indicate that iontophoresis of sodium diclofenac is more effective than that of sodium salicylate.” In
conclusion, there is some evidence for short-term efficacy of iontophoresis (40 mA-minutes, total of
6–10 treatments with either glucocorticoid or diclofenac) for lateral epicondylalgia. Six treatments are
appropriate for acute cases and 10 treatments for chronic cases, as long as the patient is showing functional
improvement. Quality studies are available on iontophoresis in subacute and chronic lateral
epicondylalgia patients and benefits have been shown. This option is moderately costly, has few side
effects, and is not invasive. Thus, iontophoresis is recommended [Recommended, Evidence (C)].<br>
<br>
Ultrasound. Twelve articles were reviewed, seven studies65,71,72,73,74,75,76 and five meta analysis.47,48,62,77,78
One study was of high quality, four of intermediate quality, and one of low quality. Some of the studies
had no placebo/control group or sham arm.65,71,72 However, two studies were triple blinded (patient,
physician/assessor, therapist).73,75 The first study had three arms—ultrasound, sham ultrasound, and
control (rest) group and a large sample of 99 patients with 33 in each group.73 Patients had pain for at
least 1 month. The second study had two arms—pulsed ultrasound and sham ultrasound and a large
sample of 76 patients with 38 in each group.75 Patients also had pain for at least 1 month. Both of these
studies showed significant improvement over rest and sham respectively. Two more studies (one with
a sample of 55 patients with pain of at least 6 weeks duration74 and another with a sample of 45
patients with pain for at least 1 month76) did not show statistically significant differences between
pulsed ultrasound (one used low-dose ultrasound74) and sham ultrasound with respect to treatment
effect. Another study treated 39 patients (30 had symptoms for over 3 months and 9 for over 1 year)
with either a four-step home exercise program or pulsed ultrasound and showed statistically significant
differences demonstrating a positive benefit for exercise.65 Finally, one review of 23 RCTs “showed
weak evidence for the effectiveness of US [ultrasound] in comparison with placebo” but “insufficient
evidence in favor of US [ultrasound] when compared to other active interventions,”77 while another
review of 38 RCTs and controlled clinical trials (n = 6 for lateral epicondylalgia) concluded that “the
inconsistent results of these high quality studies indicate weak evidence in favor of the ultrasound
therapy (proportion of positive studies, 33%)” for lateral epicondylalgia.78 In conclusion, there is evidence
for short-term efficacy with ultrasound (pulsed ratio of 1:4 and duration of 2 ms or continuous at a
frequency of 0.7–1.5 MHz, an intensity of 1.0–2.0 W/cm2, for 5–10 minutes, over a 5 cm2 treatment
area, 2–3 times per week based on objective results up to 5–6 weeks). Quality studies are available
on ultrasound in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients and benefits have been
shown. This option is moderately costly, has few side effects, and is not invasive, although it does
not appear to result in large improvements. Thus, ultrasound is recommended [Moderately
Recommended, Evidence (B)].<br>
<br>
Manipulation. For manipulation, four articles were reviewed (three intermediate-quality studies and
one meta-analysis). One study evaluated 28 patients (with symptoms for at least 6 weeks and not
more than 6 months duration) receiving manipulation of the wrist by a physical therapist to test its
impact on lateral epicondylalgia pain (palpation and resisted extension).79 However, this small study
did not have adequate statistical power to permit meaningful conclusion. Another study recruited 13
subjects (mean duration of symptoms of 16.6 weeks in one group and 12.5 weeks in the second group)
and concluded that ultrasound was more effective than manipulation.80 The third study (198 patients
with pain of at least 6 weeks duration) showed combinations of exercise and mobilization was superior
to corticosteroid injections, but was not superior to a “wait-and-see” approach at 52 weeks.10 There
was no ability to separate out effects of the exercises and mobilization as there were many different
interventions apparently incorporated in the single study. The meta-analysis indicated that “there are
no long term studies of adequate methodological quality on manual therapy.”62 Quality studies are
available on manipulation in subacute and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients, but the available
studies conflict on whether it is beneficial. This option is moderately costly, has few side effects, and
is not invasive. Thus, there is no recommendation for using manipulation [No Recommendation,
Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Massage. There are no quality studies of massage for lateral epicondylalgia. Quality studies are not
available on massage and benefits have not been shown. This option is moderately costly, has few
side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, there is no recommendation for using massage [No
Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Friction Massage. Seven articles were reviewed, four studies and three meta-analysis.47,48,62 Three of the
studies were of intermediate quality and one was of low quality. None of the studies evaluated friction
massage alone. One study evaluated corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy (which included friction
massage) and a “wait and see” approach9; one studied physical therapy (which included friction massage),
brace-only, and brace plus physical therapy54; one study examined ultrasound plus placebo, ultrasound
plus friction massage, phonophoresis, and phonophoresis plus friction massage81; and the final study
looked at Cyriax physiotherapy (which included friction massage), supervised exercise program, and
bioptron light.64 This intervention was assessed in subacute and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients.
Quality studies are not available on friction massage and benefits have not been shown. This option
is moderately costly, has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, there is no recommendation for
using friction massage [No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Magnets. There are no quality studies for using magnets to treat lateral epicondylalgia. Quality
studies are not available on magnets and benefits have not been shown. This option is low cost,
has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, there is no recommendation for using magnets
[No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy. Twelve articles were reviewed, 10 studies82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91 and two
metanalyses.62,92 Of the 10 studies, two were of high quality, five of intermediate quality and three of
low quality. One of the high-quality studies82 evaluated 60 subjects with symptoms for less than 1 year
and more than 3 weeks, treating them with either active extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)
with a simple stretching program (n = 31) or sham ESWT with a simple stretching program (n = 29).
The authors concluded that “despite improvement in pain scores and pain-free maximum grip
strength within groups, there does not appear to be a meaningful difference between treating lateral
epicondylitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy combined with forearm-stretching program and
treating with forearm-stretching program alone, with respect to resolving pain within an 8-week period
of commencing treatment.” The second high-quality study evaluated 272 patients with at least 6
months of conservative treatment (135 received ESWT and 137 received placebo ESWT) and found
that ESWT as “applied in the present study was ineffective in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.”85
One of the meta-analysis reviewed two studies, concluding “no added benefit of ESWT over that of
placebo in the treatment of LE [lateral epicondylitis].”62 The other review analyzed nine studies (the
studies reviewed above) and concluded that “when data were pooled, most benefits were not statistically
significant. No difference for participants early or late in the course of condition.”92 Quality studies are
available on extracorporeal shockwave therapy in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia
patients and benefits have not been shown. This option is moderately costly, has some short-term side
effects, and is not invasive. Thus, there is a recommendation against using extracorporeal shockwave
therapy [Strongly Not Recommended, Evidence (A)].<br>
<br>
Phonophoresis. Three studies were reviewed, two of intermediate quality and one of low quality.
Two of the studies had small sample sizes (61 and 49 participants, respectively), and no placebo
control.34,72 One of these studies also had a heterogeneous population with 69% having symptoms
for longer than 3 months (they were evaluating phonophoresis versus ultrasound in multiple body
locations), thus the sample size for those with lateral epicondylalgia had low statistical power.72 The
third study (patients with a mean duration of symptoms of 2.1, 4.3, 5.2, and 5.4 months) also did not
have a complete placebo control and the small sample size (n = 40) limited statistical power.81 Results
showed no statistically significant differences among the various experimental groups. Quality studies
are available on phonophoresis in subacute and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients and benefits
have not been shown. This option is moderately costly, has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus,
there is a recommendation against using phonophoresis [Not Recommended, Evidence (C)].<br>
<br>
Low-Level Laser Therapy. Ten articles were reviewed, eight studies93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100 and two meta analysis.62,101
Three of the studies were of high quality, four of intermediate quality, and one of low quality. The types
of laser and the techniques used varied throughout the studies. Two studies included some patients with
medial epicondylalgia; the remainder limited their subjects to those with lateral pain. Treatment sessions
were 3–5 per week for 3 to 10 weeks. Only one study of 49 patients (median duration of pain of 12 months
in the laser group and 7 months in the placebo group) demonstrated a very limited benefit of low-level
laser treatment versus placebo.99 One study of 30 patients (average duration of symptoms for 3.6 months)
found that low-level laser compared similarly with physiotherapy (deep friction massage and pulsed
ultrasound).100 A second study of 30 patients (average duration of symptoms of 4.1 months in the laser
group and 2.9 months in the placebo group) concluded that low-level laser was somewhat more
effective than placebo, but was of “limited value” in treatment.96 On the other hand, two studies (one
looked at 49 patients with a median duration of pain of 6 months and the other looked at 36 patients
with duration of symptoms ranging from 4–52 weeks) found no benefit of low-level laser in treating
epicondylalgia.93,95 One of the meta-analysis62 found “no evidence of effect over that of a placebo
intervention in either the short or long term.” The other pooled study also found “poor results” for
effectiveness and the authors concluded that “optimal treatment dose has obviously not yet have been
discovered.”101 These varied studies can be generalized to state that there is no evidence for the effectiveness
of low-level laser therapy in medial or lateral elbow pain. Quality studies are available for low-level
laser therapy in acute, subacute, and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients and benefits have not
been shown. This option is moderately costly, has few side effects, and is not invasive. Thus, there is a
recommendation against using low-level laser therapy [Strongly Not Recommended, Evidence (A)].<br>
<br>
Acupuncture. Twelve studies were reviewed on acupuncture, six studies93,102,103,104,105,106 (two used the
same population) and six meta-analysis.48,62,107,108,109,110 All of the studies were of intermediate quality.
One study evaluated 48 patients with pain of at least 2 months (average of 15.4 months) and treated
them with either a single acupuncture treatment or a placebo and concluded that “non-segmental
verum acupuncture has an intrinsic analgesic effect in the clinical treatment of tennis elbow pain
which exceeds that of placebo acupuncture.”102 Asecond study treated 45 patients (duration of symptoms
greater than 3 months) with either real acupuncture or sham acupuncture and found that the
“selection of so-called real acupuncture points gives better results than invasive sham acupuncture at
early follow-up. This additional effect can be interpreted as a specific effect of real acupuncture.”103,104
One of the meta-analysis found that “all the studies suggested that acupuncture was effective in the
short-term relief of lateral epicondylar pain. Five of six studies indicated that acupuncture treatment
was more effective compared to a control treatment. There is strong evidence suggesting that
acupuncture is effective in the short-term relief of lateral epicondyle pain.”108 Another review concluded
that there “appears to be some evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture over a placebo as a
treatment for LE [lateral epicondylitis] in short term outcomes. However, this benefit appears to be
short lived—that is, two to eight weeks.”62 On the other hand, a third meta-analysis concluded that
there is “insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of acupuncture (either needle or
laser) in the treatment of lateral elbow pain.”107 In conclusion, acupuncture—needling at depths of
1.25–2.5 cm for 20–25 minutes, 2–3 times a week for a total of 6 treatments—may be appropriate for
an initial trial of therapy for the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia, with an additional 6 if there is
evidence of objective functional improvement. Quality studies are available on acupuncture in
subacute and chronic lateral epicondylalgia patients and short-term benefits have been shown. This
option is moderately costly, is invasive, but has few side effects. Thus, there is a recommendation for
the short-term use of use of acupuncture [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, there are no quality studies available for the following interventions for lateral epicondylalgia and
benefits have not been shown. These options are moderately costly, have few side effects, and are not invasive.
Thus, there is no recommendation for them.<br>

MEDIAL EPICONDYLALGIA (Medial Epicondylitis)<br>
Medial epicondylalgia is much less common than lateral epicondylalgia, which is thought to be about seven
times more common. Medial epicondylalgia is sometimes thought to occur concomitantly with ulnar neuropathy
at the elbow. Treatment of medial epicondylalgia is inferred from the treatment of lateral epicondylalgia.
While the evidence is unclear if this is appropriate, it is assumed by the medical community that this is
correct. Therefore, it is recommended that the guidelines for lateral epicondylalgia be utilized by inference
for medial epicondylalgia.<br>
There is some evidence to support this supposition, as iontophoresis for medial epicondylalgia68 [Recommended,
Evidence (C)] and glucocorticosteroid injections appear to have the same benefits and time course for efficacy
for both disorders. For example, one high-quality study of corticosteroid injections for medial epicondylalgia
was reviewed.111 In this study, 60 elbows (58 patients with a mean duration of symptoms of 4.33±0.25 months
in the experimental group and 4.72±0.25 months in the control group) were randomized into two groups of
30. Both groups were managed with NSAIDs and physical therapy that was provided in the same physical
therapy department with “very similar protocols.” Additionally, one group received an injection of 1 cc of
1% lidocaine and 1 cc of methylprednisolone, 40 mg; the other group received an injection of 1 cc of 1%
lidocaine and 1 cc of 0.9% saline. At 6 weeks post-injection, the group receiving the steroid injection experienced
significantly less pain than the control group. There were no significant differences in the mean scores of the
two groups at 3 months or at 1 year. Quality studies are available on glucocorticoid injections in chronic
medial epicondylalgia patients and there is evidence of short-term, but not long-term benefits. This option
is invasive, but is low cost and has few side effects. Thus, glucocorticoid injections are recommended
[Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)].<br>

ACTIVITY MODIFICATION FOR ELBOW DISORDERS<br>
There are no studies regarding the efficacy of activity modifications, including workplace restrictions, and no
studies demonstrating that activity modifications alter the clinical course. Still, it is widely believed that some
activities may materially aggravate and perpetuate symptoms of lateral epicondylalgia. Quality studies are
not available on activity modifications and benefits have not been shown. This option is moderately costly,
but is not invasive and has few side effects. Thus, activity modifications are recommended if needed
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
Careful advice regarding maximizing activities within the limits of symptoms is believed to be important.
Activities that increase stress on the wrist’s extensor mechanism, which originates at the elbow, tend to
aggravate symptoms. Consequently, consideration may be given to restrictions on forceful use, lifting, and
repetitive flexion or extension following the onset of epicondylalgia.<br>
Workstation modifications to reduce the force on the elbow are believed to be important in resolving the problem
in cases where the occupational tasks materially contribute. Understanding the worksite and the employer’s
willingness to and the feasibility of modifying the workstation may be important to maintain the employee at
work and/or minimize disability time. Quality studies are not available on workstation modifications and
benefits have not been shown. This option is moderately costly, but is not invasive and has few side effects.
Thus, workstation modifications are recommended if needed [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
For each diagnosis/medical condition, return-to-work (RTW) criteria are needed. For most conditions, while
restrictions may be needed, there is not a need for time away from work. Typically, lateral epicondylalgia does
not require time off work, nor do other elbow-related musculoskeletal disorders. However, for those who
require time away from work, the physician needs to determine the best timing for the employee to
return-to-work. The physician also needs to determine what accommodations, modifications, or assistive
devices if any, are required during functional restoration that will allow an employee to return to the essential
tasks of their job or alternative work, and will allow them to return to their activities of daily living. For each
diagnosis and severity level, the physician must determine the optimal set of work restrictions, if any are
indicated. These job modifications, accommodations, or assistive devices should be based on objective
findings, either obtained through a physical examination (resistive strength, range of motion) or other formal
evaluation. Restrictions should be written in biomechanical terms, such as lifting up to 30 lbs., and not vague
language such as “light duty.” It is the employer’s responsibility, not the physician’s, to send the employee
home if he or she is unable to meet the suggested guidelines for restricted duty. Patients should be informed
that the restrictions also apply outside of work.<br>
<br>
<br>
FOLLOW-UP VISITS<br>
A patient with potentially work-related elbow disorders should have follow-up visits based on the acuity and
severity of his or her condition. For example, initial follow-up every 4–7 days by a physician may be needed
to counsel the patient about avoiding aggravating exposures, medication use, activity modification, and other
concerns. Physicians should take care to answer questions and make these sessions interactive so that the
patient is involved in his or her recovery. If the patient has returned to work and is progressing, these
interactions may be done on site or by telephone to avoid interfering with modified or full-work activities.<br>
Follow-up should occur when a release to modified, increase or full duty is needed, or after appreciable
healing or recovery can be expected. Follow-up might be expected every 4–7 days if the patient is off work
and every 7–14 days if the patient is working. After 4–6 weeks, follow-up every 2–3 weeks may be needed
until full recovery.<br>
<br>
<br>
SPECIAL STUDIES AND DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS<br>
Criteria for ordering imaging studies are:<br>
The imaging study results will substantially change the treatment plan.<br>
Emergence of a red flag.<br>
Failure to progress in a rehabilitation program, evidence of significant tissue insult or neurological
dysfunction that has been shown to be correctable by invasive treatment, and agreement by the
patient to undergo invasive treatment if the presence of the correctable lesion is confirmed.<br>
<br>
For most patients presenting with elbow problems, special studies are not needed unless a period of at least
4 weeks of conservative care and observation fails to improve their symptoms. Most patients improve quickly,
provided red flag conditions are ruled out. There are a few exceptions to the rule to avoid special studies
absent red flags in the first month. These exceptions include:<br>
Plain-film radiography to rule out osteomyelitis or joint effusion in cases of significant septic
olecranon bursitis.<br>
Electromyography (EMG) study if cervical radiculopathy is suspected as a cause of lateral arm pain,
and that condition has been present for at least 6 weeks.<br>
Nerve conduction study and possibly EMG if severe nerve entrapment is suspected on the basis
of physical examination, denervation atrophy is likely, and there is a failure to respond to
conservative treatment.<br>
<br>
For patients with limitations of activity after 4 weeks and unexplained physical findings such as effusion or
localized pain (especially following exercise), imaging may be indicated to clarify the diagnosis and revise the
treatment strategy if appropriate. Imaging findings should be correlated with physical findings.<br>
In general, an imaging study may be an appropriate consideration for a patient whose limitations due to
consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more, as in the following cases:<br>
When surgery is being considered for a specific anatomic defect.<br>
To further evaluate potentially serious pathology, such as a possible tumor, when the clinical
examination suggests the diagnosis.<br>
<br>
<br>
CHRONIC PAIN CONSIDERATIONS<br>
Chronic elbow pain may occur as a localized musculoskeletal disorder as part of a systematic pain condition
or in combination (see Chapter 6: Chronic Pain for detailed discussion on chronic pain). An accurate diagnosis
is critical, thus revisiting the diagnosis is highly important as noted above. In patients with long-lasting or
recurrent pain but without evidence that there is another specific diagnosis (e.g., radiculopathy), a careful
search for widespread pain is particularly indicated as patients frequently fail to mention other symptoms
when focusing on the area that seems to be most affected. This evaluation should especially include queries
regarding pain and discomfort in the distal upper extremities, shoulders, neck, periscapular areas, and low
back. Physical examination maneuvers should particularly include ranges of motion of those joints, qualitative
muscle strength testing (e.g., supraspinatus testing, power grasp), as well as ascertainment of pain on palpation
of muscles, tendons, and ligaments in these body regions, as well as over boney landmarks and other structures
not anticipated to be tender. Anxiety and depressive conditions, as well as somatoform disorders, are believed
to be risk factors, and such conditions need not have been previously recognized. Thus, inquiries for psychological
and psychiatric issues and administration of questionnaires (e.g., Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Modified
Somatic Perception Questionnaire, Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index112)* are
also indicated. Those with positive findings of non-localized pain, non-localized tenderness, and psychological
or psychiatric issues, have relative, but not absolute, contraindications to invasive testing or procedures.<br>
Many of the studies included in the review of interventions in this chapter included patients with chronic
pain of more than 3 months duration. Thus, many of these treatments have evidence-based treatment
recommendations in chronic elbow pain patients.<br>
<br>
<br>
SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS<br>
The timing of a referral for surgery should be consistent with the condition that has been diagnosed, the
degree of functional impairment, and the progression and severity of objective findings. Conditions that
produce objective evidence of nerve entrapment and that do not respond to non-surgical treatment can be
considered for surgery when treatment failure has been documented, in spite of compliance with treatment.
Conditions of inflammatory nature may take many months to heal and the timing of a surgical consultation
referral should take into consideration the normal healing time. Referral for surgical consultation may be
indicated for patients who have:<br>
Significant limitations of activity for more than 3 months;<br>
Failed to improve with exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength of the
musculature around the elbow; or<br>
Clear clinical and electrophysiologic or imaging evidence of a lesion that has been shown to benefit
in both the short and long term from surgical repair.<br>
<br>
Emergency consultation is reserved for patients who require drainage or aspiration of acute septic effusions,
ruptures (e.g., biceps), infected hematomas and/or drainage of infected bursitis, or who have severe acute
nerve impingement.<br>
Surgery during the first 3 months is only rarely indicated for elbow disorders that present for initial treatment.
If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks, and benefits, and especially
expectations is very important. It is also important to set pre-operative expectations that there is a necessity
to adhere to the rehabilitative exercise regimen and work through post-operative pain. In the post-operative
phase, range-of-motion exercises should involve the elbow, as well as the wrist and shoulder to avoid frozen
shoulder (“adhesive capsulitis”).<br>
<br>
A. SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR LATERAL EPICONDYLALGIA<br>
There is currently a debate regarding whether lateral epicondylalgia is an inflammatory condition or an
enthesopathy and what treatments are most appropriate. Conservative care should be maintained for a
minimum of 3–6 months. Although some individuals will improve with surgery for lateral epicondylalgia,
at this time there are no published RCTs that indicate that surgery improves the condition over non-surgical
options. There are clinical trials to compare different surgical techniques, but this type of study cannot show
the benefit of surgical intervention over medical treatment or untreated controls, particularly when numerous
studies have documented the tendency for the condition to spontaneously improve over time.<br>
Five articles were reviewed on surgery for lateral epicondylalgia, four studies113,114,115,116 and one meta-analysis.117
One of the studies was of high quality, one of intermediate quality, and two of low quality. The studies evaluated
the following techniques: 1) botulinum toxin injections versus open surgery; 2) percutaneous versus open surgery;
3) lengthening of the distal tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery versus decompression
of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) surgery; and 4) open surgery with drilling versus open surgery with
no drilling. The first study evaluated 40 patients with an average duration of symptoms of 10.5 months—half
were treated with the open (Hohmann) surgical technique and half with botulinum toxin injections.113 The
authors found that “treating chronic tennis elbow with botulinum toxin equal those of operative release.” The
second study evaluated 47 elbows (45 patients who had undergone conservative treatment for 12 months);
24 were treated with a formal open release (Nirschl) surgical technique and 23 with a percutaneous surgical
technique.114 The results showed that “those patients undergoing a percutaneous release returned to work on
average three weeks earlier and improved significantly more quickly than those undergoing an open procedure.
The percutaneous procedure is a quicker and simpler procedure to undertake and produces significantly
better results.” Another study evaluated 28 elbows (26 patients with average duration of symptoms of 23 months);
half were treated with decompression of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) surgery and half with lengthening
of the distal tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery.115 The authors found that the “overall
outcome after a mean follow-up of 31 months after the primary operation was successful in 60% of the cases.”
They concluded that the “present results seem to indicate that PIN neurolysis and lengthening of the tendon
of the ECRB muscle are of similar value in the surgical treatment of resistant tennis elbow. Neither of these
methods, however, can be considered a very effective treatment in chronic tennis elbow.” The last study evaluated
23 elbows (duration of patients symptoms not indicated) and treated them with open (Nirschl) release surgery
with drilling or without drilling.116 The author concluded that “drilling confers no benefit and actually causes
more pain, stiffness, and wound bleeding than not drilling.” Quality studies are available on surgery for
patients with chronic symptoms of lateral epicondylalgia, although they used different surgical techniques
and did not include an observation group. Benefits of less invasive procedures are suggested. This option is
high cost, invasive, and has moderate side effects. Thus, surgery for lateral epicondylalgia should only be a
consideration for those patients who fail to improve after a minimum of 6 months of care that includes at least
3–4 different types of conservative treatment. However, there are unusual circumstances in which, after 3 months
of failed conservative treatment, surgery may be considered [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
B. MEDIAL EPICONDYLALGIA<br>
Quality studies are not available on surgery for medial epicondylalgia. As noted previously, it is recommended
that treatment for medial epicondylalgia be inferred from lateral epicondylalgia; however, some anecdotal
information suggests surgical outcomes for medial epicondylalgia may be somewhat worse. This option is
high cost, invasive, and has moderate side effects. Thus, surgery for medial epicondylalgia should only be a
consideration for those patients who fail to improve after a minimum of 6 months of care that includes at
least 3–4 different types of conservative treatment. However, there are unusual circumstances in which, after
3 months of failed conservative treatment, surgery may be considered [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
C. ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT<br>
Five studies were reviewed for ulnar nerve decompression surgery118,119,120,121,122; all of intermediate quality.
All the studies compared surgical techniques. None incorporated a group receiving physical therapy or
non-intervention as a control. Also, none of the studies distinguished between the different types of ulnar
neuropathies at the elbow. Two studies118,119 compared a simple decompression procedure with anterior
subcutaneous transposition of the ulnar nerve (one did not indicate duration of patients’ symptoms and
the other included patients with symptoms for greater than 3 months); two studies121,122 (one did not indicate
duration of patients’ symptoms and the other had a mean duration of symptoms of 27 months in one group
and 24.9 months in the second group) compared a simple decompression with submuscular transposition;
and one study120 compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition with 52 patients who had
symptoms of at least 3 months. Unfortunately, the more risky and less effective transposition procedures
remain the most common. Evidence is lacking that any of these surgeries has advantages over conservative
treatment. The simple ulnar nerve release does have some evidence of benefits over more complicated
surgical procedures such as transposition.<br>
Surgery for ulnar nerve entrapment requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical evidence
and positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings. A decision to operate requires significant
loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment and that the patient
has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, use of elbow pads, removing opportunities
to rest the elbow on the ulnar groove, workstation changes (if applicable), and avoiding nerve irritation at
night by preventing prolonged elbow flexion while sleeping. Before proceeding with surgery, patients must be
apprised of all possible complications, including wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage,
and the high possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as
muscle wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.<br>
<br>
Simple Decompression<br>
Quality studies118,119,121,122 of patients with chronic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are available on surgical
treatment for ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive,
and have side effects. Yet, in well defined but infrequent cases as outlined above that include positive
electrodiagnostic studies with objective evidence of loss of function, lack of improvement may necessitate
surgery and surgery for this condition is recommended. Compared with more complex procedures, there
is evidence of benefits from simple decompression and this procedure is recommended [Recommended,
Evidence (C)].<br>
<br>
Submuscular Transposition<br>
Quality studies121,122 are available on submuscular transposition. Submuscular transposition has not been shown
to be beneficial. This surgical option for this problem is high cost, invasive, and has side effects. Thus, submuscular
transposition is not recommended [Not Recommended, Evidence (C)].<br>
<br>
Anterior Transposition<br>
Quality studies118,119,120 are available on anterior transposition for chronic ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow.
Studies show that while effective, the complication rate is higher than for simple decompression. Surgical
options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, in well-defined but infrequent
cases that include positive electrodiagnostic studies with objective evidence of loss of function where at time
of attempted decompression, indications are felt to be present necessitating anterior transposition, this may be
a reasonable option. Thus, subject to these caveats, anterior transposition is recommended [Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
Medial Epicondylectomy<br>
There is one quality study120 of chronic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow available that evaluates anterior
transposition vs. medial epicondylectomy. Neither surgery was clearly beneficial; however, there was less
pain in the group treated with medial epicondylectomy. This surgical option for this problem is high cost,
invasive, has side effects, and may not address the neuropathy. Thus, medial epicondylectomy for ulnar
neuropathy is not recommended [Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
D. RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT (INCLUDING RADIAL TUNNEL SYNDROME)<br>
Surgery for radial nerve entrapment requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical
evidence. Positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings should be present. A decision to operate
requires significant loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment
and that the patient has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, and workstation
changes (if applicable). Before proceeding with surgery, patients must be apprised of all possible complications,
including the extent of the incision, wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage, and the high
possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as muscle
wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.
Quality studies are not available on surgical treatment for radial nerve entrapment and there is not evidence
of its benefits. If, after at least 3–6 months of conservative treatment, the patient fails to show signs of
improvement, surgery may be a reasonable option if there is unequivocal evidence of radial tunnel syndrome
that includes positive electrodiagnostic studies and objective evidence of loss of function as outlined above.
Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, lack of improvement may
in infrequent circumstances necessitate surgery and surgery for this condition is recommended
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
E. PRONATOR SYNDROME<br>
Surgery for pronator syndrome requires establishing a firm diagnosis on the basis of clear clinical evidence.
Positive electrical studies that correlate with clinical findings should be present. A decision to operate requires
significant loss of function, as reflected in significant activity limitations due to the nerve entrapment and that
the patient has failed conservative care, including full compliance in therapy, and workstation changes
(if applicable). Before proceeding with surgery, the patient must be apprised of all possible complications,
including the extent of the incision, wound infections, anesthetic complications, nerve damage, and the
possibility that surgery will not relieve symptoms. Absent findings of severe neuropathy such as muscle
wasting, at least 3–6 months of conservative care should precede a decision to operate.<br>
Quality studies are not available on surgical treatment for pronator syndrome and there is not evidence of its
benefits. If after at least 3–6 months of conservative treatment the patient fails to show signs of improvement,
surgery may be a reasonable option if there is unequivocal evidence of pronator syndrome that includes
positive electrodiagnostic studies and objective evidence of loss of function as outlined above. Surgical options
for this problem are high cost, invasive, and have side effects. Yet, lack of improvement may in infrequent
circumstances necessitate surgery; thus, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended,
Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
F. BICEPS RUPTURE<br>
Biceps tendinosis may be severe enough to involve a biceps rupture. This generally occurs in the setting of
supramaximal use of force and requires surgical repair in most employed patients. (It is important to note
that this recommendation is for a biceps tendon rupture, not a bicipital tendon rupture, which occurs in the
bicipital groove at the shoulder and often does not require surgery.) Quality studies are not available on
surgery for biceps ruptures and there is not evidence of benefits due to the low incidence and severity of these
issues. However, while surgery is high cost, invasive, and has some potential for side effects, outcomes appear
much better with surgery as this muscle is the main forearm flexor. Thus, while there is insufficient evidence,
surgery for a ruptured biceps is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
G. OLECRANON BURSITIS (ASEPTIC)<br>
Aseptic (uninfected) olecranon bursitis generally resolves without the need for surgery. Quality studies are
not available on surgical treatment for aseptic olecranon bursitis and there is not evidence of its benefits. If
after at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment the patient fails to show signs of improvement, surgery may
be reasonable. Surgical options for this problem are high cost, invasive, and may have more side effects for
this condition than continued conservative care. Yet, lack of improvement may in rare circumstances necessitate
surgery; thus, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
<br>
H. OLECRANON BURSITIS (SEPTIC)<br>
Septic (infected) olecranon bursitis is either a complication of aseptic olecranon bursitis or a direct consequence
of trauma. Generally, to be a complication of aseptic olecranon bursitis also requires introduction of organisms
through the skin, such as abraded skin or an injection. Signs include swelling, pain, tenderness, and pain on
range of motion. Quality studies are not available on this subject and there is not evidence of its benefits;
however, septic olecranon bursitis (especially if loculated) usually requires surgical drainage. Surgical options
are high cost, invasive, but surgical outcomes have few side effects for this condition. Thus, while there is
insufficient evidence, surgery for this condition is recommended [Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].
During the recovery phase, treatment options are the same as those for aseptic olecranon bursitis with the
additional treatment of antibiotics that are required from the time the condition is recognized as an infection
[Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)].<br>
