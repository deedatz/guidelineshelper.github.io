        <div class="doc-section">
            <p>
                (a) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) "General course of therapy" means the number of visits and/or time interval which shall be indicated for postsurgical treatment for the specific surgery in the postsurgical physical medicine treatment recommendations set forth in subdivision (d)(1) of this section.
            </p>
            <p>
                (2) "Initial course of therapy" means one half of the number of visits specified in the general course of therapy for the specific surgery in the postsurgical physical medicine treatment recommendations set forth in subdivision (d)(1) of this section.    
            </p>
            <p>
                (3) "Postsurgical physical medicine period" means the time frame that is needed for postsurgical treatment and rehabilitation services beginning with the date of the procedure and ending at the time specified for the specific surgery in the postsurgical physical medicine treatment recommendations set forth in subdivision (d)(1) of this section. For all surgeries not covered by these guidelines the postsurgical physical medicine period is six (6) months.    
            </p>
            <p>
                (4) "Surgery" means a procedure listed in the surgery chapter of the Official Medical Fee Schedule with follow-up days of 90 days.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (5) "Visit" means a date of service to provide postsurgical treatment billed using the physical medicine section of the Official Medical Fee Schedule.   
            </p>
            <p>
            (b) Application
            <br />
                (1) The postsurgical treatment guidelines apply to visits during the postsurgical physical medicine period only and to surgeries as defined in these guidelines. At the conclusion of the postsurgical physical medicine period, treatment reverts back to the applicable 24-visit limitation for chiropractic, occupational and physical therapy pursuant to Labor Code section 4604.5(d)(1).   
            </p>
            <p>
            (c) Postsurgical Patient Management
            <br />
                (1) Only the surgeon who performed the operation, a nurse practitioner or physician assistant working with the surgeon, or a physician designated by that surgeon can make a determination of medical necessity and prescribe postsurgical treatment under this guideline.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (2) The medical necessity for postsurgical physical medicine treatment for any given patient is dependent on, but not limited to, such factors as the comorbid medical conditions; prior pathology and/or surgery involving same body part; nature, number and complexities of surgical procedure(s) undertaken; presence of surgical complications; and the patient's essential work functions.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (3) If postsurgical physical medicine is medically necessary, an initial course of therapy may be prescribed. With documentation of functional improvement, a subsequent course of therapy shall be prescribed within the parameters of the general course of therapy applicable to the specific surgery. If it is determined that additional functional improvement can be accomplished after completion of the general course of therapy, physical medicine treatment may be continued up to the end of the postsurgical physical medicine period.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (4) Patients shall be reevaluated following continuation of therapy when necessary or no later than every forty-five days from the last evaluation to document functional improvement to continue physical medicine treatment. Frequency of visits shall be gradually reduced or discontinued as the patient gains independence in management of symptoms and with achievement of functional goals.    
            </p>
            <p>
                (A) In the event the patient sustains an exacerbation related to the procedure performed after treatment has been discontinued and it is determined that more visits are medically necessary, physical medicine treatment shall be provided within the postsurgical physical medicine period.    
            </p>
            <p>
                (B) In cases where no functional improvement is demonstrated, postsurgical treatment shall be discontinued at any time during the postsurgical physical medicine period.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (5) Treatment is provided to patients to facilitate postsurgical functional improvement.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (A) The surgeon who performed the operation, a nurse practitioner or physician assistant working with the surgeon, or physician designated by that surgeon, the therapist, and the patient should establish functional goals achievable within a specified timeframe.    
            </p>
            <p>
                (B) Patient education regarding postsurgical precautions, home exercises, and self-management of symptoms should be ongoing components of treatment starting with the first visit. Intervention should include a home exercise program to supplement therapy visits.   
            </p>
            <p>
                (C) Modalities (CPT [as defined in section 9789.10(d)] codes 97010 through 97039) should only be performed in conjunction with other active treatments. Although these modalities are occasionally useful in the post surgical physical medicine period, their use should be minimized in favor of active physical rehabilitation and independent self-management.   
            </p>
            <p>
            (d) Postsurgical Physical Medicine Treatment Recommendations
            <br />
                (1) The postsurgical physical medicine treatment recommendations, as listed below, indicate frequency and duration of postsurgical treatment for specific surgeries. The specified surgeries in these guidelines are not all inclusive. Requests for postsurgical physical medicine treatment not included in these guidelines shall be considered pursuant to section 9792.21(c). The physical medicine treatment recommendations (listed alphabetically) are adapted from the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) except where developed by the Division of Workers' Compensation and indicated as "[DWC]." The postsurgical physical medicine period is identified by an asterisk [*] as developed by DWC.

                Ankle and Foot
            </p>
            <p>
                Exercise program goals should include strength, flexibility, endurance, coordination, and education. Patients can be advised to do early passive range-of-motion exercises at home by a therapist. (Colorado, 2001) (Aldridge, 2004) This RCT (randomized controlled trial) supports early motion (progressing to full weight-bearing at 8 weeks from treatment) as an acceptable form of rehabilitation in surgically treated patients with Achilles tendon ruptures.

Occupational therapy and physical therapy for the patient with burns may include respiratory management, edema management, splinting and positioning, physical function (mobility, function, exercise), scar management, and psychosocial elements. (Simons, 2003) As with any treatment, if there is no improvement after 2-3 weeks the protocol may be modified or re-evaluated.

                Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
            </p>                
            <p>
                Recommended as indicated below. There is limited evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PT (physical therapy) or OT (occupational therapy) for CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome). The evidence may justify 3 to 5 visits over 4 weeks after surgery, up to the maximums shown below. Benefits need to be documented after the first week, and prolonged therapy visits are not supported. Carpal tunnel syndrome should not result in extended time off work while undergoing multiple therapy visits, when other options (including surgery for carefully selected patients) could result in faster return to work. Furthermore, carpal tunnel release surgery is a relatively simple operation that also should not require extended multiple therapy office visits for recovery. Of course, these statements do not apply to cases of failed surgery and/or misdiagnosis (e.g., CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) I instead of CTS). (Feuerstein, 1999) (O'Conner-Cochrane, 2003) (Verhagen-Cochrane, 2004) (APTA, 2006) (Bilic, 2006) Post surgery, a home therapy program is superior to extended splinting. (Cook, 1995) Continued visits should be contingent on documentation of objective improvement, i.e., VAS (visual analog scale) improvement greater than four, and long-term resolution of symptoms. Therapy should include education in a home program, work discussion and suggestions for modifications, lifestyle changes, and setting realistic expectations. Passive modalities, such as heat, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, ultrasound and electrical stimulation, should be minimized in favor of active treatments.

                Used after surgery and amputation. During immobilization, there was weak evidence of improved hand function in the short term, but not in the longer term, for early occupational therapy, and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises. Post-immobilization, there was weak evidence of a lack of clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving formal rehabilitation therapy, passive mobilization or whirlpool immersion compared with no intervention. There was weak evidence of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion (post external fixation), intermittent pneumatic compression and ultrasound. There was weak evidence of better short-term hand function in patients given therapy than in those given instructions for home exercises by a surgeon.

                Patient rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury is divided into two periods: acute and subacute. In the beginning of rehabilitation therapist evaluates patient's functional status, later he uses methods and means of treatment, and evaluates effectiveness of rehabilitation. Early ambulation is very important for patients with coma. Therapy consists of prevention of complications, improvement of muscle force, and range of motions, balance, movement coordination, endurance and cognitive functions. Early rehabilitation is necessary for traumatic brain injury patients and use of therapy methods can help to regain lost functions and to come back to the society. (Colorado, 2005) (Brown, 2005) (Franckeviciute, 2005) (Driver, 2004) (Shiel, 2001)

                A therapy program that starts immediately following hip surgery allows for greater improvement in muscle strength, walking speed and functional score. (Jan, 2004) (Jain, 2002) (Penrod, 2004) (Tsauo, 2005) (Brigham, 2003) (White, 2005) (National, 2003) A weight-bearing exercise program can improve balance and functional ability to a greater extent than a non-weight-bearing program. (Expert, 2004) (Binder, 2004) (Bolgla, 2005) (Handoll, 2004) (Kuisma, 2002) (Lauridsen, 2002) (Mangione, 2005) (Sherrington, 2004) Patients with hip fracture should be offered a coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation program with the specific aim of regaining sufficient function to return to their pre-fracture living arrangements. (Cameron, 2005) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

            <p>
                Controversy exists about the effectiveness of therapy after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. (Goodwin, 2003) Functional exercises after hospital discharge for total knee arthroplasty result in a small to moderate short-term, but not long-term, benefit. In the short term therapy interventions with exercises based on functional activities may be more effective after total knee arthroplasty than traditional exercise programs, which concentrate on isometric muscle exercises and exercises to increase range of motion in the joint. (Minns Lowe, 2007) Accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation intervention after hip and knee arthroplasty (including intense therapy and exercise) reduced mean hospital length of stay (LOS) from 8.8 days before implementation to 4.3 days after implementation.

                As compared with no therapy, therapy (up to 20 sessions over 12 weeks) following disc herniation surgery was effective. Because of the limited benefits of therapy relative to massage, it is open to question whether this treatment acts primarily physiologically, but psychological factors may contribute substantially to the benefits observed.
