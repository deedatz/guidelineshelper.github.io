<br>
General Approach and Basic Principles<br>
Forearm, wrist, and hand complaints that may be work related are common
problems presenting to occupational and primary care providers; they are
among the five most common causes of reported work-related health complaints
of workers’ compensation claims. These complaints account for about
7 to 8% of total lost workdays in workers’ compensation and 17-23% of cases
and claims, ranking them in the top five for financial severity, much of the
total expense is incurred for surgical procedures.<br>
Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with work-related forearm,
wrist, or hand complaints are presented in this clinical practice guideline.
Topics include the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients with acute
and subacute forearm, wrist, or hand complaints that may be work related,
identification of red flags that may indicate the presence of a serious underlying
medical condition, initial management, diagnostic considerations and special
studies for identification of clinical pathology, work-relatedness, modified duty
and activity, and return to work, as well as further management considerations,
including the management of delayed recovery.<br>
Algorithms for patient management are included. This chapter’s master
algorithm schematizes how primary care and occupational medicine practitioners
may generally manage patients with acute and subacute forearm,
wrist, and hand complaints. The following text, tables, and numbered algorithms
expand upon the master algorithm.<br>
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with
acute and subacute forearm, wrist, and hand complaints are as follows:<br>
The initial assessment focuses on detecting indicators of potentially
serious disease, termed red flags.<br>
In the absence of red flags, occupational or primary care providers
can safely and effectively manage work-related forearm, hand, and
wrist complaints. The focus is on monitoring for complications, facilitating
the healing process, and facilitating return to work in a modifiedor
full-duty capacity.<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by modifying
activities, temporary immobilization, and systemic nonprescription analgesics.<br>
Encourage patients recovering from acute or subacute forearm, hand,
or wrist problems to return to modified work as their condition permits.<br>
Referral for specialty care may be indicated if symptoms persist beyond
four to six weeks.<br>
Address nonphysical factors (such as psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems) in an effort to resolve delayed recovery.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Assessment<br>
Thorough medical and work histories as well as a focused physical examination
(see Chapter 2) are sufficient for the initial assessment of a patient complaining
of potentially work-related forearm, wrist, or hand symptoms. The medical
history and examination include evaluation for serious underlying conditions.
This evaluation may consider the possibility of referred pain to the forearm,
wrist, and/or hand due to a disorder in another part of the body (e.g., cervical
nerve root). Certain findings on the history and physical examination raise
suspicion of serious underlying medical conditions; these are referred to as
red flags (see Table 11-1). Their absence rules out the need for special studies,
referral, or inpatient care during the first four weeks, during which time
spontaneous recovery is expected (provided any inciting workplace factors are
addressed). Forearm, hand, and wrist complaints can then be classified into
one of four working categories:<br>
Potentially serious forearm, hand, or wrist condition: fracture, acute
dislocation, infection, neurovascular compromise or injury, or tumor,
in rare cases.<br>
Mechanical disorders: derangements of the forearm, hand, or wrist
related to acute trauma, such as ligament or tendon strain.<br>
Degenerative disorders: resulting from aging or repetitive use, or a
combination thereof, such as arthritis, tendinitis, or tenosynovitis.<br>
Nonspecific disorders: occurring in the hand or wrist and suggesting
neither internal derangement nor referred pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Medical History<br>
Asking the patient open-ended questions, such as those listed on page 256,
allows the clinician to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries
to obtain more detailed information (see also Chapter 2):<br>
WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?<br>
Do you have pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or limited motion?<br>
For traumatic injuries:Was the area deformed? Did you lose any blood
or have an open wound?<br>
Are your symptoms located primarily in the hand or wrist? Do you
have pain or other symptoms elsewhere (e.g., forearm, neck)?<br>
Are your symptoms constant or intermittent? What makes the problem
worse or better?<br>
Is the pain better or worse at any particular time of day?<br>
HOW DO THESE SYMPTOMS LIMIT YOU?<br>
Can you do hand intensive activities? For how long?<br>
What stops you from working? Are the symptoms worse at work?<br>
Can you grasp? How much? Are you dropping things?<br>
Are the symptoms worse at night? Do they wake you up? How often?<br>
What have you tried to make it better? Does it work?<br>
WHEN DID YOUR CURRENT LIMITATIONS BEGIN?<br>
WAS THERE A SPECIFIC INCITING EVENT? HOW DID
THE LIMITATIONS DEVELOP?<br>
How long have your activities been limited? More than four weeks?<br>
Have your symptoms changed? How?<br>
Have you had similar episodes previously?<br>
Have you had previous testing or treatment? With whom?<br>
What do you think caused the problem? How do you think it is related
to work?<br>
What are your specific job duties? Do you use your forearm, wrist, or
hand to perform them? How? How often?<br>
What are your hobbies? Do you use your forearm, wrist, or hand to
perform them? How? How often?<br>
Do you use vibrating tools or devices at work or at home (anything
from air guns to blow dryers)? What effect, if any, do these devices
have on your symptoms?<br>
Do you have other medical problems? For example, pregnancy, diabetes,
or hypothyroidism.<br>
WHAT DO YOU HOPE WE CAN ACCOMPLISH DURING
THIS VISIT?<br>
1If pregnant and has carpal tunnel syndrome, the problem will likely go away after delivery.
Work reassignment or modification may be indicated for any of these comorbid conditions.<br>

<br>
<br>
Physical Examination<br>
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination includes:<br>
General observation of the patient<br>
Regional examination of forearms, wrists, and hands as well as neck
evaluation, if indicated by the history<br>
Neurologic screening<br>
<br>
In most cases, the examination is subjective because the patient must exert
voluntary effort or state a response to the sensory examination. In some cases
of forearm, wrist, or hand problems, there are no objective findings. Strictly
objective findings do not in any way require the patient’s cooperation for
determination. A palpable trigger finger is an objective finding, but any sensory
findings are subjective because the patient reports the finding. Thenar atrophy
is objective, while tenderness over a ligament or tendon is subjective. The
presence of a visible ganglion is objective, though not necessarily work related,
but whether pain is associated with it or there is tenderness on examination
is subjective.<br>
Though it may seem a point too obvious to warrant mention, the physician
should specifically note which forearm, wrist, or hand—left or right—is the
subject of the patient’s complaints. Not infrequently, injured workers have
prior workers’ compensation claims that involve the opposite forearm, wrist,
or hand. Any ambiguity in documentation can lead to delay in acceptance of
the patient’s workers’ compensation claim, delay in the authorization of timeloss
benefits, delay in the authorization of payment of medical care, or even
outright denial of the workers’ compensation claim.<br>
The physician should seek objective evidence of pathology that is consistent
with the patient’s subjective complaints. In many cases, careful examination
will reveal one or more truly objective findings, such as swelling, deformity,
atrophy, reflex changes or spasm. Any such findings should be thoroughly
documented in the medical record both for reference during future visits, and
for the value the information will have in the patient’s workers’ compensation
claim. For some patients with forearm, wrist, or hand, complaints, however,
there are no objective findings. Meticulous documentation of the patient’s
complaints at each visit is of the utmost importance in such cases.<br>
<br>
A. Regional Examination of Forearm, Hand, and Wrist<br>
Because they are interrelated structures, the forearm, wrist, and hand can be
examined together for observation of any swelling, masses, redness, deformity,
or other abnormality. This examination may be followed by evaluating active
and passive range of motion within the patient’s limits of comfort with the area
as relaxed as possible. Local tenderness may be accentuated by specific motions
or stresses on specific joints, and active muscle contraction may produce pain,
indicating a specific tendinitis. If this latter finding is on the radial side of the
wrist, it suggests a diagnosis of DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis. Specific areas of
decreased pinprick sensation may indicate median or ulnar nerve compression;
tapping the area of the nerve may produce dysesthesias in its distribution (a
positive Tinel’s sign). If the patient’s flexing the wrist for a period of 60 seconds
elicits dysesthesias in the median innervated digits, then this is a positive Phalen’s
test.<br>
Several traditional findings of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have limited
specific diagnostic value. The various tests for CTS show a broad range of sensitivity,
depending on the patient population. Clinicians should depend on more
than one test. The most sensitive screening methods seem to be an abnormal
Katz hand diagram, abnormal sensibility by Semmes-Weinstein testing, and
night discomfort. Hypalgesia in the median nerve distribution and thumb abduction
strength testing also have been found to be helpful in establishing the
diagnosis of CTS. The flick sign is another diagnostic tool. (The sign is positive
when a patient reports shaking his or her hand in an effort to relieve parathesias.)
Table 11-3 lists various tests for CTS along with estimated sensitivity and specificity
based on metaanalysis of existing studies.<br>
Trigger finger nodules may be palpable both actively and passively. There
may be only palmar tenderness over proximal interphalangeal joints. The presence
of a ganglion is easily determined, but the severity of any symptoms is the
basis for a decision to aspirate or, in persistent cases, to excise the cyst.<br>
<br>
B. Neurovascular Screening
The neurologic and vascular status of the hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow,
including peripheral pulses, and the motor, reflex, and sensory status of the
forearm, hand, and wrist as well as the more proximal surrounding structures,
can be assessed. Examining the neck and cervical nerve root function is also
in order becauseC6radiculopathycanaffect the wrist extensorsandT1radiculopathy
can present as dysfunction of the intrinsic muscles of the hand (see Table
8-3).
C. Assessing Red Flags<br>
The forearm, wrist, and hand area may present with signs of serious infection
or tumor (rarely metastatic) or manifest symptoms and signs of serious systemic
disease (e.g., inflammatory arthritis, vascular disease), or neurologic conditions.
Significant trauma requires evaluation for fracture or crush injury, while
a history of deformity consistent with dislocation and spontaneous reduction
requires surgical (preferably hand surgery) consultation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diagnostic Criteria<br>
If there are no red flags present to indicate serious conditions, the clinician
can then determine which common musculoskeletal disorder is present. The
criteria presented in Table 11-2 follow the clinical thought process, from the
mechanism of illness or injury to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder and, finally, to test results if any tests are needed to guide treatment
at this stage.<br>

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>
CTS does not produce hand or wrist pain. It most often causes digital numbing
or tingling primarily in the thumb, index, and long finger or numbness in
the wrist. Symptoms of pain, numbness, and tingling in the hands are common
in the general population, but based on studies, only about one in five symptomatic
subjects would be expected to have CTS based on clinical examination
and electrophysiologic testing.<br>
Clinical testing may include:<br>
Administration of a Katz hand diagram: The patient is provided with
a form that shows outlines of the arms, and the palmar and dorsal
surfaces of the hands. The patient identifies areas of discomfort—
characterizing them as pain, numbness, tingling, or other—on each
of the diagrams the patient finds necessary. The results are termed
‘‘probable,’’ ‘‘possible,’’ or ‘‘unlikely,’’ depending upon specified criteria.<br>
Testing for Tinel’s sign: Up to six taps to the soft tissue overlying the
carpal tunnel. A positive test occurs when the taps cause paresthesias
in the median nerve distribution.<br>
Performing the Semmes-Weinstein test: A test involving nylon monofilaments
that collapse at specific amounts of force when pushed perpendicularly
against the palm or fingers. A positive test results when
a filament of greater than normal size is required in order for its
application to be perceived by the patient.<br>
Durkan’s test: The examiner holds the supinated wrist in both hands
and applies direct, even pressure over the transverse carpal ligament
with both thumbs for up to 30 seconds. A positive test is indicated
by tingling or paresthesia into the thumb, index finger, and middle
and lateral half of the ring finger within 30 seconds.<br>
Testing for Phalen’s sign: Prolonged, forced hyperflexion of the wrist
is produced by requesting the patient to push the dorsa of both hands
together, and to hold that position with the wrists in 90 degrees of
flexion for sixty seconds. A positive test produces paresthesias in the
distribution of the affected median nerve.<br>
Checking for the square wrist sign: The square wrist sign is positive
if the ratio of the thickness of the wrist divided by the width of the
wrist is greater than 0.7.<br>
<br>
Appropriate electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) may help differentiate between
CTS and other conditions, such as cervical radiculopathy. These may
include nerve conduction studies (NCS), or in more difficult cases, electromyography
(EMG) may be helpful. NCS and EMG may confirm the diagnosis
of CTS but may be normal in early or mild cases of CTS. If the EDS are
negative, tests may be repeated later in the course of treatment if symptoms
persist.<br>
The American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, the American
Academy of Neurology, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine
and Rehabilitation jointly published a practice parameter for electrodiagnostic
studies in CTS. In patients with suspected CTS, the following EDS studies
are recommended:<br>
1. Perform a median sensory NCS across the wrist with a conduction
distance of 13 to 14 centimeters. If the result is abnormal, compare
the result of the median sensory NCS to the result of a sensory NCS
of one other adjacent sensory nerve in the symptomatic limb.<br>
2. If the initial median sensory NCS across the wrist has a conduction
distance greater than 8 cmand the result is normal, one of the following
additional studies is recommended:<br>
a. Comparison of median-sensory- or mixed-nerve conduction across
the wrist over a short (7 to 8 cm) conduction distance with ulnarsensory-
nerve conduction across the wrist over the same 7- to 8-
cm conduction distance<br>
b. Comparison of median-sensory conduction across the wrist with
radial- or ulnar-sensory conduction across the wrist in the same
limb<br>
c. Comparison of median-sensory or mixed-nerve conduction
through the carpal tunnel to sensory- or mixed-nerve conduction
velocity of proximal (forearm) or distal (digit) segments of the
median nerve in the same limb<br>
Many other in-office tests and symptoms have varying predictive value for
CTS, as summarized in Table 11-3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Relatedness<br>
A thorough work history is crucial to establishing work-relatedness. (See
Chapter 2 for components of the work history.) Determining whether a complaint
of a hand, wrist, or forearm disorder is related to work requires a careful
analysis and weighing of all associated or apparently causal factors operative
at the time.A predominance of work factors suggests that worksite intervention
would be appropriate. A cluster of cases in a work group suggests a greater
probability of associated work design or management factors.<br>
Repetitive work, especially pinch grasping and, possibly, keyboard work,
is currently thought to have the potential to contribute to wrist or hand
tendinitis. Problems with workstations have been associated with CTS and
DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis. The strength of these associations is not clear.
Identification and ameliorization of other factors may be important, including
compression at the wrist, awkward posture interacting with force, and the
effect of sustained head and shoulder postures for office workers and computer
users. Acute trauma at work can be associated with tendon and ligament
strains.<br>
The clinician may recommend work and activity modifications or ergonomic
redesign of the workplace to facilitate recovery and prevent recurrence.
The employer’s role in accommodating activity limitations and preventing
further problems through ergonomic changes is key to hastening the employee’s
return to full activity. In some cases it may be desirable to conduct a detailed
ergonomic analysis of activities that may be contributing to the symptoms. A
broad range of ergonomic surveys and instruments is available for measuring
range of activity, strain, weights, reach, frequency of motion, flexion, and
extension, as well as psychological factors such as organizational relationships
and job satisfaction. Such detailed measures may be necessary or useful for
modifying activity, for redesigning the workstation, or for suggesting organizational
and management relief. Such cases may call for referral to a certified
human factors engineer or ergonomist, either through the patient or the
employer.<br>

Initial Care<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s first concern. Nonprescription analgesics will
provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute symptoms. If treatment response is inadequate (that is, if symptoms and activity
limitations continue), prescribed pharmaceuticals or physical methods may be
added. Clinicians should consider the presence of medical diseases such as
diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vitamin B complex deficiency, and arthritis. Side
effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences should guide the clinician’s
choice of recommendations. Initial treatment of CTS should include night
splints. Day splints can be considered for patient comfort as needed to reduce
pain, along with work modifications. For patients with mild-to-moderate CTS
who opt for conservative treatment, studies show that corticosteroids may be
of greater benefit than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but
side effects prevent their general recommendation. Vitamin B6 is often used
in CTS when it is perceived to be deficient, but this practice is not consistently
supported by the medical evidence. Table 11-4 summarizes comfort options.<br>

acute dislocations, patients should be advised to do early range-ofmotion
exercises at home. Instruction in proper exercise technique is
important, and a physical therapist can serve to educate the patient
about an effective exercise program.<br>
<br>
Manipulation has not been proven effective for patients with pain in
the hand, wrist, or forearm. Studies show that therapeutic touch is no
better than placebo in influencing median-motor-nerve distal latencies,
pain scores, and relaxation scores. Using a magnet for reducing pain
attributed to CTS is no more effective than using the placebo device.<br>
<br>
Physical modalities, such as massage, diathermy, cutaneous laser treatment,
‘‘cold’’ laser treatment, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation
(TENS) units, and biofeedback have no scientifically proven
efficacy in treating acute hand, wrist, or forearm symptoms. Limited
studies suggest there are satisfying short- to medium-term effects due
to ultrasound treatment in patients with mild to moderate idiopathic
CTS, but the effect is not curative. Patients’ at-home applications of
heat or cold packs may be used before or after exercises and are as
effective as those performed by a therapist.<br>
<br>
Most invasive techniques, such as needle acupuncture and injection
procedures, have insufficient high quality evidence to support their
use. The exception is corticosteroid injection about the tendon sheaths
or, possibly, the carpal tunnel in cases resistant to conservative therapy
for eight to twelve weeks. For optimal care, a clinician may always try
conservative methods before considering an injection. DeQuervain’s
tendinitis, if not severe, may be treated with a wrist-and-thumb splint
and acetaminophen, then NSAIDs, if tolerated, for four weeks before
a corticosteroid injection is considered. CTS may be treated for a
similar period with a splint and medications before injection is considered,
except in the case of severe CTS (thenar muscle atrophy and
constant paresthesias in the median innervated digits). Outcomes from
carpal tunnel surgery justify prompt referral for surgery in moderate
to severe cases, though evidence suggests that there is rarely a need
for emergent referral. Thus, surgery should usually be delayed until
a definitive diagnosis of CTS is made by history, physical examination,
and possibly electrodiagnostic studies. Symptomatic relief from a cortisone/
anesthetic injection will facilitate the diagnosis; however, the
benefit from these injections is short-lived. Trigger finger, if significantly
symptomatic, is probably best treated with a cortisone/anesthetic
injection at first encounter, with hand surgery referral if symptoms
persist after two injections by the primary care or occupational medicine
provider (see Table 11-4).<br>
<br>
When treating with a splint in CTS, scientific evidence supports the
efficacy of neutral wrist splints. Splinting should be used at night, and
may be used during the day, depending upon activity.<br>
<br>
Support for iontophoresis and phonophoresis is limited.<br>
<br>
Activity alteration.<br>
<br>
Careful advice regarding maximizing activities within the limits of symptoms
is imperative once red flags have been ruled out. Any splinting or limitations
placed on hand, wrist, and forearm activity should not interfere with total
body activity in a major way. Strict elevation can be done for a short period
of time at regular intervals.<br>
Activities that increase stress on the hand or wrist may contribute to
structural damage and tend to aggravate symptoms. Limitations of keyboard
work or pinch-grasping may be necessary during the first few weeks after onset
of acute tendinitis, tenosynovitis, nerve impingement, or irritation around a
ganglion.<br>
Evidence shows that keyboard users may experience a reduction in hand
pain after several months of using some alternative geometry keyboards, although
the benefit appears to be dependent upon user preference.<br>
<br>
<br>
Job Analysis<br>
While not all CTS or other hand and wrist complaints are occupational in
origin, complaints of workplace discomfort should be evaluated for ergonomic
modifications as part of the treatment program. Careful ergonomic re-analysis
of the job is indicated if the individual fails to improve. Delayed recovery or
return of symptoms may suggest an association between job tasks or motions
and the presenting complaint.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Activities<br>
Table 11-5 provides recommendations on activity modification and duration
of absence from work. These guidelines are intended for patients without
comorbidity or complicating factors, including employment or legal issues.
They are targets to provide a guide from the perspective of physiologic recovery.<br>
Key factors to consider in disability duration are age and type of job,
especially if the regular work includes activities that may aggravate the condition.
By communicating with patients and employers, clinicians can make it
clear that:<br>
Even moderate pinch-grasping or extension and flexion may aggravate
forearm, hand, and wrist symptoms.<br>
Restrictions may allow for recovery or time to build activity tolerance
through exercise<br>

<br>
Follow-up Visits<br>
Patients with potentially work-related forearm, wrist, and hand complaints
should have follow-up every three to five days by a midlevel practitioner, or
by a physical or hand therapist who can counsel them about avoiding static
positions, medication use, activity modification, and other concerns. Take care
to answer questions and make these sessions interactive so that the patient is
duly involved in his or her recovery. If the patient has returned to work, these
interactions may be done on site or by telephone, to avoid interfering with
modified- or full-work activities.<br>
Physician follow-up can occur when the patient needs a release to modified,
increased, or full duty, or after appreciable healing or recovery can be expected,
on average. Physician follow-up might be expected every four to seven days
if the patient is off work and seven to fourteen days if the patient is working.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
For most patients presenting with true hand and wrist problems, special studies
are not needed until after a four- to six-week period of conservative care and
observation. Most patients improve quickly, provided red flag conditions are
ruled out. Exceptions include the following:<br>
In cases of wrist injury, with snuff box (radial-dorsal wrist) tenderness,
but minimal other findings, a scaphoid fracture may be present. Initial
radiographic films may be obtained but may be negative in the presence
of scaphoid fracture. A bone scan may diagnose a suspected scaphoid
fracture with a very high degree of sensitivity, even if obtained within
48 to 72 hours following the injury.<br>
An acute injury to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, accompanied
by tenderness on the ulnar side of the joint and laxity when
that side of the joint is stressed (compared to the other side), may
indicate a gamekeeper thumb or rupture of the ligament at that location.
Radiographic films may show a fracture; stress views, if obtainable,
may show laxity. The diagnosis may necessitate surgical repair of the
ligament; therefore, a surgical referral is warranted.<br>
In cases of peripheral nerve impingement, if no improvement or worsening
has occurred within four to six weeks, electrical studies may be
indicated. The primary treating physician may refer for a local lidocaine
injection with or without corticosteroids.<br>
Recurrence of a symptomatic ganglion that has been previously aspirated
or a trigger finger that has been previously treated with local
injections (see Table 11-4) is usually an indication for re-aspiration or
referral, based on the treating physician’s judgment.<br>
A number of patients with hand and wrist complaints will have associated
disease such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vitamin B complex
deficiency and arthritis. When history indicates, testing for these or
other comorbid conditions is recommended.<br>
If symptoms have not resolved in four to six weeks and the patient
has joint effusion, serologic studies for Lyme disease and autoimmune
diseases may be indicated. Imaging studies to clarify the diagnosis may
be warranted if the medical history and physical examination suggest
specific disorders. Table 11-6 provides a general comparison of the
abilities of different imaging techniques to identify physiologic insult
and define anatomic defects.<br>

Surgical Considerations<br>
Referral for hand surgery consultation may be indicated for patients who:<br>
Have red flags of a serious nature<br>
Fail to respond to conservative management, including worksite modifications<br>
Have clear clinical and special study evidence of a lesion that has been
shown to benefit, in both the short and long term, from surgical
intervention<br>
<br>
Surgical considerations depend on the confirmed diagnosis of the presenting
hand or wrist complaint. If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding
likely outcomes, risks and benefits, and, especially, expectations is very important.
If there is no clear indication for surgery, referring the patient to a
physical medicine practitioner may aid in formulating a treatment plan.<br>
<br>
A. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>
Surgical decompression of the median nerve usually relieves CTS symptoms.
High-quality scientific evidence shows success in the majority of patients with
an electrodiagnostically confirmed diagnosis of CTS. Patients with the mildest
symptoms display the poorest postsurgery results; patients with moderate or
severe CTS have better outcomes from surgery than splinting. CTS must be
proved by positive findings on clinical examination and the diagnosis should
be supported by nerve-conduction tests before surgery is undertaken. Mild
CTS with normal electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) exists, but moderate or
severe CTS with normal EDS is very rare. Positive EDS in asymptomatic
individuals is not CTS. Studies have not shown portable nerve conduction
devices to be effective diagnostic tools. Surgery will not relieve any symptoms
from cervical radiculopathy (double crush syndrome). Likewise, diabetic patients
with peripheral neuropathy cannot expect full recovery and total abatement
of symptoms after nerve decompression.<br>
Risks of surgical decompression include complications of anesthesia,wound
infection,anddamageto themediannerve.Incompletedecompression or recurrence
of symptoms can lead to the need for further surgery. Based on the data
fromthe randomized controlled trials, endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to
be an effective procedure compared to open surgery; however, greater emphasis
must be given to training surgeons in this technique to avoid major complications
such as median nerve injuries.With proper training and equipment, endoscopic
carpal tunnel release can be done safely, with complication rates
comparable to those for the open technique and with high patient satisfaction.
Early return to work after either type carpal tunnel surgery is more dependent
on the willingness of the employer and patient than on the surgical technique.
Two prospective randomized studies show no beneficial effect from postoperative
splinting after carpal tunnel release when compared to a bulky dressing
alone. In fact, splinting the wrist beyond 48 hours following CTS release may
be largely detrimental, especially compared to a home therapy program.<br>
<br>
B. Trigger Finger<br>
One or two injections of lidocaine and corticosteroids into or near the thickened
area of the flexor tendon sheath of the affected finger are almost always
sufficient to cure symptoms and restore function. A procedure under local
anesthesia may be necessary to permanently correct persistent triggering.<br>
<br>
C. DeQuervain’s Syndrome<br>
The majority of patients with DeQuervain’s syndrome will have resolution
of symptoms with conservative treatment. Under unusual circumstances of
persistent pain at the wrist and limitation of function, surgery may be an
option for treating DeQuervain’s tendinitis. Surgery, however, carries similar
risks and complications as those already mentioned above (see A, ‘‘Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome’’), including the possibility of damage to the radial nerve
at the wrist because it is in the area of the incision.<br>
<br>
D. Ganglion<br>
Only symptomatic wrist ganglia merit or excision, if aspiration fails. Recurrences
may be spontaneous or related to inadequate removal of the communication
with the carpal joints or to satellite ganglia that the surgeon failed to excise.<br>
