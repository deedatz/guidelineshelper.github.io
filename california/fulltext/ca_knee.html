<br>
General Approach and Basic Principles<br>
Knee complaints that are potentially related to work are common problems
presenting to occupational and primary care providers—they are among the
ten most common causes of reported occupational complaints and workers’
compensation claims. Knee complaints account for 7-8% of total benefits paid
for workers’ compensation medical care and temporary disability, ranking
them in the top ten for financial severity. However, about a quarter of the
total expense is incurred for surgical procedures whose efficacy is not supported
by available evidence, as summarized in this guideline.<br>
Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with potentially workrelated
knee problems are presented in this clinical practice guideline. Topics
include the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients with acute and subacute
knee complaints that potentially are work related; identification of red flags
that may indicate the presence of a serious underlying medical condition;
initial management; diagnostic considerations and special studies for identifying
clinical pathology; work-relatedness; modified duty and activity; return
to work; and further management considerations, including the management
of delayed recovery.<br>
Algorithms for patient management are included. This chapter’s master
algorithm schematizes how primary care and occupational medicine practitioners
generally can manage patients with acute and subacute knee complaints.
The following text, tables, and numbered algorithms expand upon
the master algorithm.<br>
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with
knee complaints are as follows:<br>
The initial assessment of patients with acute and subacute knee problems
focuses on detecting indications of potentially serious disease,
termed red flags.<br>
In the absence of red flags, work-related knee complaints can be
managed safely and effectively by occupational or primary care providers.
The focus is on monitoring for complications, facilitating the
healing process, and facilitating return to work in modified- or fullduty.<br>
In the absence of red-flag signs or symptoms, evaluation and treatment
can proceed in the acute phase for four to six weeks without performing
special studies because the yield of treatment-altering findings is low
and most patients’ conditions improve within that period of time.<br>
Patients can be introduced to the concept of load and overload. Load
is beneficial for the muscle, tendon, skeleton, and cartilage; overload
is not beneficial. The adaptation of physical activities is crucial; total
rest does more harm than good.<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by temporary
immobilization, reduction in weight bearing, and systemic nonprescription
analgesics.<br>
Patients recovering from acute knee injury or infection should be
encouraged to return to modified-duty work as soon as their condition
permits.<br>
If symptoms persist beyond four weeks, referral for specialty care may
be indicated.<br>
Nonphysical factors, such as psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems, may be investigated and addressed in cases of delayed
recovery or return to work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Assessment<br>
Thorough medical and work histories and a focused physical examination (see
Chapter 2) are sufficient to assess the worker complaining of potentially workrelated
knee symptoms. The initial history and examination include evaluation
for serious underlying conditions. This evaluation should consider the possibility
of referred knee pain due to a disorder in another part of the body,
particularly the low back or hip. Certain findings on the history and physical
examination raise suspicion of serious underlying medical conditions known
as red flags (see Table 13-1). Their absence rules out the need for special
studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first four to six weeks, when
spontaneous recovery is expected (provided any inciting workplace factors are
mitigated). Knee complaints then can be classified into one of four working
categories:<br>
Potentially serious knee conditions: fractures, dislocation, infection,
neurovascular compromise, tumors, etc.<br>
Mechanical disorders: derangements of the knee related to acute
trauma, such as ligament strain or meniscus or ligament tears<br>
Degenerative disorders: consequences of aging or repetitive use, or
a combination thereof, such as patellofemoral syndrome (formerly
commonly referred to as chondromalacia), bursitis, or tendinitis<br>
Nonspecific disorders: occurring in the knee and suggesting neither
internal derangement nor referred pain<br>
<br>

<br>
Medical History<br>
Asking the patient open-ended questions such as those listed below allows
the clinician to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries to
obtain more detailed information (see also Chapter 2):<br>
WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?<br>
Do you have pain, weakness, limited motion, popping, clicking, locking,
recurrent swelling, or giving way?<br>
For traumatic injury: Was the area deformed? Did you lose any blood
or have an open wound?<br>
If swelling is reported: How long was it following the injury that your
knee became swollen?<br>
Are the symptoms located primarily in the knee? Do you have pain
or other symptoms elsewhere (e.g., low back, hip)?<br>
Is the pain constant or intermittent? What makes the problem worse
or better?<br>
DO THESE SYMPTOMS LIMIT YOUR ACTIVITIES? IF SO,
HOW?<br>
Can you walk or carry weight? For how long?<br>
Can you lift? How much weight?<br>
Are your symptoms worse when climbing or going down stairs or
hills?<br>
WHEN DID YOUR CURRENT LIMITATIONS BEGIN?<br>
WAS THERE A SPECIFIC INCITING EVENT THAT LED TO
THE SYMPTOMS?<br>
How did the limitations develop?<br>
How long have your activities been limited? More than four weeks?<br>
Have your symptoms changed? How?<br>
Have you had similar episodes previously?<br>
Have you had previous testing or treatment? With whom?<br>
What do you think caused the problem? How do you think it is related
to work?<br>
What are your specific job duties? Do you use your knees? How? How
often?<br>
DO YOU HAVE OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS?<br>
Do you have any autoimmune or metabolic diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis or gout?<br>
Do you have arthritis in any other joint?<br>
Have you had cancer?<br>
WHAT DO YOU HOPE WE CAN ACCOMPLISH DURING
THIS VISIT?<br>
<br>
Knee complaints as described by the patient can sometimes be referred from
other sources. Hip pathology can produce distal thigh symptoms and knee
pain in the absence of knee pathology. Likewise, sciatic or femoral nerve
irritation or hip disease can cause knee symptoms.<br>
<br>
<br>
Physical Examination<br>
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination includes:<br>
General observation of the patient<br>
Focused examination of the knee on the affected side<br>
Neurovascular screening<br>
<br>
Care should be taken to document which knee—left or right—is the subject
of the examination. Not infrequently, injured workers have prior workers’
compensation claims that involve the opposite knee, or pain in the opposite
knee that is unrelated to employment. Any ambiguity in documentation that
identifies the knee being examined can lead to delay in acceptance of the
patient’s workers’ compensation claim, delay in the authorization of time-loss
benefits, delay in the authorization of payment of medical care, or even outright
denial of the workers’ compensation claim.<br>
The physician should seek objective evidence of pathology that is consistent
with the patient’s subjective complaints. In many cases, careful examination
will reveal one or more truly objective findings, such as swelling, deformity,
atrophy, reflex changes or spasm. Any such findings should be thoroughly
documented in the medical record both for reference during future visits, and
for the value the information will have in the patient’s workers’ compensation
claim. For some patients with knee complaints, however, there are no objective
findings. Meticulous documentation of the patient’s complaints at each visit
is of the utmost importance in such cases.<br>
Though it may seem a point too obvious to warrant mention, the physician
should specifically note which knee—left or right—is the subject of the patient’s

claims that involve the opposite knee. Any ambiguity in documentation
can lead to delay in acceptance of the patient’s workers’ compensation claim,

payment of medical care, or even outright denial of the workers’ compensation

is of the utmost importance in such cases.<br>
<br>
A. Focused Knee Examination<br>
Knee examinations should be performed in a thorough and careful manner
in order to identify any clinically significant pathology that may be present.
A considerable number of patients may present with findings such as grinding,
clicking, popping, and pain, yet do not necessarily have clinically significant
intraarticular pathology or require more than conservative care. Patients presenting
with sensations of instability or locking require further investigation.<br>
Initially, the patient’s gait and the appearance of the knees can be observed
during stance. Difficulty walking, as well as deformity (e.g., excessive varus
or valgus), swelling, redness, and inability to fully extend are all observable
in this manner. In the supine position, smaller effusions, tenderness and its
location (e.g., at joint lines), and range of motion can be determined. The
posterior structures of the knee also can be inspected and palpated, including
the popliteal fossa. Collateral ligament stability can be checked by applying
varus and valgus stress (pressure) with the joint slightly flexed. Cruciate ligament
competence is determined by pulling the tibia forward at 30 degrees
(Lachman test) and 90 degrees (drawer test). The knee also can be examined
at 0 degrees. The McMurray test is limited to testing defects of the posterior
horn.<br>
A history of anterior knee pain and popping and clicking may suggest
patellofemoral syndrome (PFS, formerly known as chondromalacia patella).
Patients with tenderness over the patellar tendon or its insertion may have
patellar tendinitis or Osgood-Schlatter disease, a congenital condition. Knee
catching, locking, or swelling may be secondary to meniscus tears, patellofemoral
instability or ligamentous injury. Patellar instability often presents as a
constant dull pain.<br>
<br>
B. Neurovascular Screening<br>
The neurologic and vascular status of the knee and distal lower extremity can
be routinely assessed. Evidence of lumbar disk disease, with radiculopathy and
radiation to the knee, also may be sought because neurologic changes may
be present in the lower extremity.<br>
<br>
C. Assessing Red Flags<br>
Signs of neurovascular compromise, unreduced dislocation, infection, or
tumor that correlate with the patient’s medical history and test results may
indicate a need for immediate consultation. A medical history suggestive
of pathology originating somewhere other than in the knee may warrant
examination of the back, hip, or other areas.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diagnostic Criteria<br>
If the patient does not have red flags for serious conditions, the clinician
can then determine which common musculoskeletal disorder is present. The
criteria presented in Table 13-2 follow the clinical thought process, from the
mechanism of illness or injury to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder and, finally, to test results, if any tests are needed to guide treatment
at this stage.<br>

Work-Relatedness<br>
A thorough work history is crucial to establishing work-relatedness. See Chapter
2 for components of the work history.<br>
Repeated trauma, for example crawling or working in a crouched position
under load, is currently thought to contribute to tendinitis and nonspecific
knee pain, although the strength of the association is not great. Working on
the knees is thought to contribute to prepatellar bursitis. Trauma from vibration,
such as jackhammer use, is thought to contribute to patellofemoral
syndrome. Repetitive motion under load may contribute to meniscus damage
in older workers. Acute trauma at work may cause acute meniscus tears,
ligament strains, and ligament ruptures.<br>
Patellar tendinitis and osteoarthritis usually do not have causative associations
with acute trauma (see Chapter 1). However, aggravations of these conditions
may have connection with work activities. Heavy workload, previous knee
injury, and/or an overweight patient are all predictors of aggravation of osteoarthritis and can be addressed.
The medical history becomes crucial in determining
this relationship; nonwork as well as work activities have to be evaluated. If a
history of past injury is associated with the onset of symptoms and the present
complaint has the identical presentation, a relationship to the past injury may
exist. It is important to establish the level of function that existed before the
current health complaint. This is because the goal of treatment will be to return
the patient at least to that state; because the underlying problem may well be
chronic, its elimination may be unrealistic. The patient can be asked to identify
when this level has been reached, because treatment beyond that point will likely
be reduced to the level of maintenance and observation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Care<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s first concern. Nonprescription analgesics will
provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute symptoms.
If treatment response is inadequate (i.e., if symptoms and activity limitations
continue), prescribed pharmaceuticals or physical methods can be added.
Comorbid conditions, side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences
guide the clinician’s choice of recommendations. Table 13-3 summarizes comfort
options.<br>
A number of treatment options are available to the clinician treating acute
and subacute knee pain. These options include:<br>
Instruction in home exercise. Except in cases of significant injury,
patients with knee problems can be advised to do early straight-legraising
and active range-of-motion exercises, especially bicycling, as
tolerated. The emphasis is on closed-chain exercises1 and muscle retraining. Instruction in proper exercise technique is important and a
few visits to a physical therapist can serve to educate the patient about
an effective exercise program. The clinician or therapist should teach
the patient rehabilitation programs for knee problems.<br>
<br>
Closed-chain exercises are those in which the feet remain in contact with the floor throughout
the exercise. Squats are an example of closed-chain exercises. Conversely, open-chain exercises
are those in which the feet do not maintain floor contact. Straight-leg extensions are openchain
exercises.<br>
<br>
Patient’s at-home applications of heat or cold packs may be used before
or after exercises and are as effective as those performed by a therapist.<br>
<br>
Some studies have shown that transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation
(TENS) units and acupuncture may be beneficial in patients with
chronic knee pain, but there is insufficient evidence of benefit in acute
knee problems.<br>
<br>
Sophisticated rehabilitation programs involving equipment should be
reserved for significant knee problems as an alternative to surgery or
for postoperative rehabilitation. Properly conducted, these programs
minimize the active participation of the therapist and direct the patient
to take an active role in the program by simply using the equipment
after instruction and then graduating to a home program.<br>
<br>
Physical modalities, such as massage, diathermy, cutaneous laser treatment,
ultrasound, and biofeedback have no scientifically proven efficacy
in treating acute knee symptoms.<br>
<br>
Invasive techniques, such as needle aspiration of effusions or prepatellar
bursal fluid and cortisone injections, are not routinely indicated. Knee
aspirations carry inherent risks of subsequent intraarticular infection.<br>
<br>
A reddened, hot, swollen area may be a sign of cellulitis or infected
prepatellar bursitis; thus, aspirating the joint through such an area
is not recommended because microorganisms may be introduced
into a previously sterile joint space.<br>
<br>
If a patient has severe pain with motion, septic effusion of the
knee joint is a possibility, and referral for aspiration, Gram stain,
culture, sensitivity, and possibly lavage may be indicated. Initial
atraumatic effusions without signs of infection may be aspirated
for diagnostic purposes.<br>
<br>
There is a high rate of recurrence of effusions after aspiration, but
the procedure may be worthwhile in cases of large effusions or if
there is a question of infection in the bursa.<br>
<br>
Patients with recurrent effusions who have a history of gout or
pseudogout may need aspiration to rule out infection, but more
likely will need it only for comfort, if at all. Osteoarthritis can
present with effusions, but findings of crepitus, palpable osteophytes,
and history of chronic symptoms are usually sufficient to
make the differential diagnosis.<br>
<br>
Swelling and sponginess anterior to the patella is consistent with
a diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis.<br>
<br>
Other miscellaneous therapies have been evaluated and found to be
ineffective. In particular, iontophoresis and phonophoresis have no
proven efficacy.<br>
<br>
Manipulation does not appear to be effective in alleviating knee pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Activity Alteration<br>
The principle of maximizing activities while recovering froma physical problem
applies to knee problems as well as problems involving other parts of the body.
Non-weight-bearing exercises, such as swimming or floor exercises, can be
carried out while allowing the affected knee to rest before undergoing specific
exercises to rehabilitate the area at a later date. Weight-bearing exercises, as
tolerated, can begin as soon as possible provided no exacerbation of structural
damage will occur. Weight bearing helps avoid the adverse effects of nonweight-
bearing, such as loss of muscle mass, loss of strength, and diffuse
osteopenia. The knee disorders under discussion almost always can bear weight,
as tolerated. For example, treatment could include a partial weight-bearing
gait using crutches with the affected leg on the floor and with the weight
distributed between crutches and leg by adjusting the amount of force applied
with arms on the crutches. Even at the acute stage, however, patients can
usually perform appropriate lower extremity exercises, and can remove the
immobilizer for active range-of-motion exercises, at least twice a day. Using
load-bearing exercises and movement is far more beneficial to the muscle,
tendon, skeleton, and cartilage than is total rest, but it also is crucial to avoid
overloading the knee.<br>
Activities and postures that increase stress on a structurally damaged knee
tend to aggravate symptoms. Patients with acute ligament tears, strains, or
meniscus damage of the knee can often perform only limited squatting and
working under load during the first few weeks after return to work. Patients
with prepatellar bursitis should avoid kneeling. Patients with any type of knee
injury or disorder will find prolonged standing and walking to be difficult,
but return to modified-duty work is extremely desirable to maintain activities
and prevent debilitation. A brace can be used for patellar instability, anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, or medical collateral ligament (MCL) instability
although its benefits may be more emotional (i.e., increasing the patient’s
confidence) than medical. Usually a brace is necessary only if the patient is going
to be stressing the knee under load, such as climbing ladders or carrying boxes.
For the average patient, using a brace is usually unnecessary. In all cases, braces
need to be properly fitted and combined with a rehabilitation program.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Activities<br>
Occupational clinicians often are called on to make specific recommendations
about activities at work for patients with acute limitations due to knee problems.
Work-activity modification can be discussed at the initial and subsequent
encounters with patients. Education about avoiding painful positions may
help the patient maintain partial activities and thus avoid debilitation. The
patient’s age, general health and condition, and perceptions of safe limits for
walking, standing, stooping, twisting, and kneeling (noted on initial history)
help in formulating recommendations on reasonable starting points for activity.<br>
The clinician can make it clear to patients and employers that:<br>
Even moderately heavy, unassisted carrying, stooping, crouching, etc.
may aggravate knee symptoms caused by any of the diagnoses under
discussion.<br>
Any restrictions are intended to allow for spontaneous recovery or for
the time necessary for the development of activity tolerance through
exercise.<br>
<br>
Table 13-4 provides a guide for recommendations on activity modification,
and data on disability duration. These are intended to apply to patients without
comorbidity or complicating factors, including legal or employment issues.
The activity modification table is intended to provide activity-related guidance
that will maximize the chances for a prompt recovery. The disability-duration
data are presented to provide assistance in determining when the length of
recovery has reached the point that reconsideration should be given to the
diagnosed condition, the treatment plan, or the injured worker’s degree of
participation in that plan.<br>

Follow-up Visits<br>
Patients with knee complaints should have follow-up every three to five days,
whether in person or with brief telephone or e-mail contact, by a midlevel
practitioner or physical therapist who can counsel the patient about avoiding
static positions, medication use, activity modification, and other concerns.
The practitioner can answer questions and make these sessions interactive so
that the patient is fully involved in his or her recovery. If the patient has
returned to work, these interactions may be done on site or by telephone to
avoid interfering with modified- or full-work activities.<br>
Physician follow-up is appropriate when a release to modified, increased,
or full duty is needed, or after appreciable healing or recovery can be expected,
on average. Physician follow-up might be expected every four to seven days
if the patient is off work and every seven to fourteen days if the patient is
working.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
Special studies are not needed to evaluate most knee complaints until after a
period of conservative care and observation. The position of the American
College of Radiology (ACR) in its most recent appropriateness criteria list
the following clinical parameters as predicting absence of significant fracture
and may be used to support the decision not to obtain a radiograph following
knee trauma:<br>
Patient is able to walk without a limp<br>
Patient had a twisting injury and there is no effusion<br>
<br>
The clinical parameters for ordering knee radiographs following trauma
in this population are:<br>
Joint effusion within 24 hours of direct blow or fall<br>
Palpable tenderness over fibular head or patella<br>
Inability to walk (four steps) or bear weight immediately or within a
week of the trauma<br>
Inability to flex knee to 90 degrees<br>
<br>
Most knee problems improve quickly once any red-flag issues are ruled
out. For patients with significant hemarthrosis and a history of acute trauma,
radiography is indicated to evaluate for fracture.<br>
Reliance only on imaging studies to evaluate the source of knee symptoms
may carry a significant risk of diagnostic confusion (false-positive test results)
because of the possibility of identifying a problem that was present before
symptoms began, and therefore has no temporal association with the current
symptoms. Even so, remember that while experienced examiners usually can
diagnose an ACL tear in the nonacute stage based on history and physical
examination, these injuries are commonly missed or overdiagnosed by inexperienced
examiners, making MRIs valuable in such cases. Also note that MRIs
are superior to arthrography for both diagnosis and safety reasons. Table 13-
5 provides a general comparison of the abilities of different techniques to
identify physiologic insult and define anatomic defects.<br>

Surgical Considerations<br>
Referral for surgical consultation may be indicated for patients who have:<br>
Activity limitation for more than one month; and<br>
Failure of exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength
of the musculature around the knee.<br>
<br>
Earlier, emergency consultation is reserved for patients who may require
drainage of acute effusions or hematomas. Referral for early repair of ligament
or meniscus tears is still a matter for study because many patients can have
satisfactory results with physical rehabilitation and avoid surgical risk.<br>
<br>
A. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears<br>
Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction generally is warranted only for patients
who have significant symptoms of instability caused by ACL incompetence.
Anterior cruciate ligament tears often are followed by an immediate
effusion of the knee. A history of frequent giving-way episodes, or falls during
activities that involve knee rotation, is consistent with the condition. A physical
examination in an acute setting may be unrevealing because of the effusion
and immobilization of the knee. In addition, the physical examination may
reveal clear signs of instability as shown by positive Lachman, drawer, and
pivot-shift tests. It is important to confirm the clinical findings with MRI
evidence of a complete tear in the ligament. Especially in cases involving partial
ACLtears, substantial improvement in symptoms may occur with rehabilitation
alone. In complete tears, consideration should be given to the patient’s age,
normal activity level, and the degree of knee instability caused by the tear.
Surgical reconstruction of the ACL may provide substantial benefit to active
patients, especially those under 50 years old. For the patient whose work or
life does not require significant loading of the knee and other stressful conditions,
ACL repair may not be necessary.<br>
Complications of wound infection and untoward anesthetic events are
possible but rare. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is noted in the
literature to have various rates of failure, and it is appropriate to warn the
patient of this possibility. After the procedure, the rehabilitation period involves
six months of intense concentration and work by the patient; the patient’s
willingness to undergo the rehabilitative process must be determined by the
practitioner and may be discussed with the patient. Besides providing
the patient with educational literature, the practitioner may want to have the
patient meet with someone who is going through the rehabilitation process.
Such a meeting might help the patient determine whether he or she will be
able to follow through with the intense process. Older patients may be less
motivated to go through rehabilitation, and the work environment can be
examined before deciding upon the need for ACL repair.<br>
<br>
B. Meniscus Tears<br>
Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy usually has a high success rate for cases in
which there is clear evidence of a meniscus tear—symptoms other than simply
pain (locking, popping, giving way, recurrent effusion); clear signs of a buckethandle
tear on examination (tenderness over the suspected tear but not over
the entire joint line, and perhaps lack of full passive flexion); and consistent
findings on MRI. However, patients suspected of having meniscal tears, but
without progressive or severe activity limitation, can be encouraged to live
with symptoms to retain the protective effect of the meniscus. If symptoms
are lessening, conservative methods can maximize healing. In patients younger
than 35, arthroscopic meniscal repair can preserve meniscal function, although
the recovery time is longer compared to partial meniscectomy. Arthroscopy
and meniscus surgery may not be equally beneficial for those patients who
are exhibiting signs of degenerative changes.<br>
<br>
C. Collateral Ligament Tears<br>
Isolated collateral ligament tears have been shown to heal with excellent results
without surgical intervention. When accompanying cruciate or meniscus injuries
are ruled out, the patient can be treated non-operatively. Rehabilitative
exercises will be needed.<br>
<br>
D. Patellofemoral Syndrome<br>
Although arthroscopic patellar shaving has been performed frequently for
PFS, long-term improvement has not been proved and its efficacy is questionable.
Severe patellar degeneration presents a problem not easily treated by
surgery. Patellectomy and patellar replacements in reasonably active patients
yield inconsistent results, and the procedures have a reasonable place only
in treating patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis or another rheumatoid
condition. Lateral arthroscopic release may be indicated in cases of recurrent
subluxation of the patella, but surgical realignment of the extensor mechanism
may be indicated in some patients.<br>
