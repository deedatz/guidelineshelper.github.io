<br>
General Approach and Basic Principles<br>
Foot and ankle complaints that are potentially work related are common
problems presenting to occupational and primary care providers; they are
among the ten most common causes of reported work-related health complaints
and workers’ compensation claims. These complaints account for about
15% of claims, 7% of costs, and 6 to 7% of total lost workdays in workers’
compensation, ranking them in the top ten for financial severity as well.<br>
Recommendations for assessing and treating adults with potentially workrelated
ankle and foot problems are presented in this clinical practice guideline.
Topics include the initial assessment and diagnosis of patients with acute and
subacute ankle or foot complaints that may be work related, identification of
red flags that may indicate the presence of a serious underlying medical condition,
initial management, diagnostic considerations and special studies for
identification of clinical pathology, work-relatedness, modified duty and activity,
return to work, and further considerations, including the management of
delayed recovery.<br>
Algorithms for patient management are included. This chapter’s master
algorithm schematizes the recommended way primary care and occupational
medicine practitioners should manage patients with acute or subacute ankle
and foot complaints. The following text, tables, and numbered algorithms
amplify the guidelines of the master algorithm.<br>
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with
ankle and foot complaints are as follows:<br>
The initial appropriate assessment of patients with ankle and foot
problems focuses on detecting red-flag indicators of potentially serious
injury or disease.<br>
In the absence of red flags, work-related foot and ankle complaints
can be safely and effectively managed by occupational or primary care
providers. The focus is on monitoring for complications, facilitating
activity and the healing process, and facilitating return to work in a
modified- or full-duty capacity.<br>
Relieving discomfort can be accomplished most safely by temporary
immobilization, elevation, use of heat and cold, restricted weight bearing,
and systemic nonprescription analgesics.<br>
Patients recovering fromacute foot and ankle injury or infection should
be encouraged to return to modified work as soon as their condition
permits.<br>
If symptoms persist more than four weeks, referral for specialty care
may be indicated.<br>
Nonphysical factors, such as psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems and non-anatomic pain, should be addressed in an
effort to resolve delayed recovery.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Assessment<br>
Thorough medical and work histories and a focused physical examination (see
Chapter 2) are sufficient for the initial assessment of a patient complaining
of potentially work-related foot or ankle symptoms. The initial medical history
and examination involves evaluating for serious underlying conditions, including
sources of foot and ankle pain in other parts of the body. Certain findings
in this assessment raise suspicion of serious underlying medical conditions,
which are referred to as red flags (see Table 14-1). Their absence rules out
the need for special studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first four
weeks, during which time spontaneous recovery is expected (provided any
contributing workplace factors are mitigated). Foot and ankle complaints can
then be classified into one of four working categories:<br>
Potentially serious foot and ankle conditions: fractures, acute dislocation,
neurovascular compromise, tendon rupture, or infection<br>
Acute mechanical disorders: derangements of the foot or ankle related
to acute trauma, such as ligament strain<br>
Chronic mechanical or degenerative disorders: possible consequences
of aging or repetitive use, or a combination thereof, such as
degenerative arthritis and chronic tendinitis, tenosynovitis, or tendinosis<br>
Referred pain or paresthesias<br>
Nonspecific disorders: occurring in the foot or ankle and suggesting
neither internal derangement nor referred pain<br>
<br>
<br>
Medical History<br>
Asking the patient open-ended questions, such as those listed below, allows
the clinician to gauge the need for further discussion or specific inquiries to
obtain more detailed information (see also Chapter 2):<br>
WHAT ARE YOUR PROBLEMS WITH YOUR FOOT OR ANKLE?<br>
When did they begin?<br>
Did a specific inciting event cause the symptoms?<br>
Are your problems pain, weakness, and/or limited motion in your
ankle or foot?<br>
For traumatic injuries: Was the area deformed or bent? Did you lose
any blood or have an open wound?<br>
Are the problems located primarily in the foot or ankle? Do you have
pain or other problems elsewhere (e.g., low back, knee)?<br>
Are your problems constant or intermittent?<br>
What makes the problem worse?<br>
What makes the problem better?<br>
What can’t you do, and/or what do you have difficulty doing as a
result of these problems?<br>
Can you walk or bear weight? For how long?<br>
How long have your activities been limited? More than four weeks?<br>
Have your problems changed?<br>
Have you had similar episodes previously?<br>
Have you had previous testing or treatment? With whom?<br>
What do you think caused the problem? How do you think it is related
to work?<br>
What are your specific job duties?<br>
What activities cause problems for you?<br>
How long do you spend performing each duty on a daily basis?<br>
What other activities (hobbies, workouts, sports) do you engage in at
home or elsewhere? Is this problem limiting you in those activities?
If so, how? How often?<br>
What would you like to be able to do that you cannot do now?<br>
Do you have other medical problems?<br>
What do you hope we can accomplish during this visit?<br>
<br>
A medical history suggesting pathology originating somewhere other than in
the foot or ankle may warrant examination of the back, knee on the affected
side, or other areas.<br>

<br>
<br>
Physical Examination<br>
Guided by the medical history, the preferred method of physical examination
includes:<br>
General observation of the patient<br>
Regional examination of the feet and ankles<br>
Neurologic screening<br>
<br>
In most cases, the examination is subjective because patient response or
interpretation is required for findings on the examination. Some patients with
foot or ankle problems have no objective findings. Some will present with
painful or excessive range of motion and areas of tenderness or stiffness (loss
of mobility). Atrophy is an objective finding and may be present in longstanding
cases. A ‘‘frozen’’ area (marked loss of motion) may be present, as
may signs of infection or deformity due to fracture or dislocation, although
these cases are much less common than nonspecific pain.<br>
Though it may seem a point too obvious to warrant mention, the physician
should specifically note which ankle or foot—left or right—is the subject of
the patient’s complaints. Not infrequently, injured workers have prior workers’
compensation claims that involve the opposite ankle or foot. Any ambiguity
in documentation can lead to delay in acceptance of the patient’s workers’
compensation claim, delay in the authorization of time-loss benefits, delay in
the authorization of payment of medical care, or even outright denial of the
workers’ compensation claim.<br>
The physician should seek objective evidence of pathology that is consistent
with the patient’s subjective complaints. In many cases, careful examination
will reveal one or more truly objective findings, such as swelling, deformity,
atrophy, reflex changes, or spasm. Any such findings should be thoroughtly
documented in the medical record both for reference during future visits, and
for the value the information will have in the patient’s workers’ compensation
claim. For some patients with ankle or foot complaints, however, there are
no objective findings. Meticulous documentation of the patient’s complaints
at each visit is of the utmost importance in such cases.<br>
<br>
A. Regional Foot and Ankle Examination<br>
In the recommended focused foot and ankle examination, the clinician observes
the foot for heel position and arch shape as the patient bears weight.
Inspecting the medial and lateral aspects of the foot and ankle can help determine
the most likely site of injury because swelling and ecchymosis often
occur over the site of injury. Deformities due to fractures or dislocations may
be visible abnormalities. Signs of infection (e.g., redness, heat, swelling) also
may be visible.<br>
Carefully palpate the foot for tender areas, and assess the lateral and medial
ligamentous structures of the ankle. The distal fibula, distal tibia, proximal
fibula, and proximal fifth metatarsal should be palpated because they are the
areas most often injured in avulsion fractures. Inspecting and palpating the tendinous
insertions of the leg muscles also may aid in the diagnosing the injury
and rule out a more serious condition, such as an Achilles tendon rupture.
The range of motion of the foot and ankle should be determined both actively
and passively, for instance, by asking the patient to move the foot and ankle
within the limits of symptoms and then engaging in gentle range of motion
of the joints (rear foot, midfoot, forefoot, toes) passively for comparison.
Resisted range of motion may be used to assess strength and the presence of
injury in associated muscles. Atrophy of calf muscles is an objective finding,
but one that arises only after weeks to months of problems.<br>
Ligamentous testing can be performed to assess the presence of ankle
instability. It includes the anterior drawer test, talar tilt test, and squeeze test.
Observe adjacent ankle structures, such as the tendons. The anterior drawer
test is performed with the foot in neutral position. Hold the foot firmly at
the heel while applying a backward, posterior force to the tibia. If significant
anterior displacement of the foot relative to the distal tibia can be felt, it
indicates a significant injury to the anterior talofibular ligament. The talar tilt
test gently applies inversion force to the affected ankle; due to immediate postinjury
pain, this examination may best be performed after pain has subsided. A
positive test indicates lateral ligamentous laxity. Findings fromboth the anterior
drawer test and talar tilt test can be compared with the unaffected, contralateral
ankle. The squeeze test may be used if medial injury or severe lateral injury
has taken place. Place the hands about six inches distal to the knee with thumbs
on the fibula and fingers on the medial tibia. Then squeeze the leg to bring
the fibula and tibia together. Pain during this test indicates syndesmotic injury,
and prolonged recovery is likely.<br>
Observe weight-bearing skeletal alignment of the foot and ankle in relation
to the whole body for local skeletal malalignment and correlated and compensatory
motions and postures. Observe foot and ankle motion during gait;
during other work-related tasks and other home-related tasks. Is pain the
limiter of the task? Observe:<br>
Strength<br>
Pain location, intensity, link with activity<br>
Stiffness<br>
Balance<br>
Ligamentous laxity<br>
Joint accessory motion<br>
<br>
B. Neurovascular Screening<br>
Assessment of the neurologic and vascular status of the foot and ankle (including
skin temperature, peripheral pulses, and the motor, reflex, and sensory
status of the foot and ankle as well as the more proximal surrounding structures)
is recommended. Observe the skin for trophic changes. Examination
of lumbosacral nerve root function also is in order because L5 radiculopathy
can affect the foot and toe extensors and S1 radiculopathy can affect plantar
flexion (see Chapter 12). Patients with peripheral neuropathy (e.g., diabetics)
may have decreased sensation in the foot or ankle and neuropathic joints
presenting as acute swelling or inflammation. Peripheral nerve entrapment
may be manifested as foot drop if the peroneal nerve at the knee is involved
or, rarely, as a tarsal tunnel syndrome, presenting as numbness of the plantar
surface of the foot and toes. Foot drop also can be seen in L5 neuropathy
due to an L4-5 disc protrusion.<br>
<br>
C. Assessing Red Flags<br>
Physical examination evidence of neurovascular compromise that correlates
with the medical history and test results may indicate a need for immediate
consultation. The examination may further reinforce or reduce suspicions of
tumor, infection, tendon rupture, metabolic disorder, fracture, or dislocation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diagnostic Criteria<br>
If the patient does not have red flags for serious conditions, the clinician
can then determine which common musculoskeletal disorder is present. The
criteria presented in Table 14-2 follow the clinical thought process, from the
mechanism of illness or injury to unique symptoms and signs of a particular
disorder and finally to test results, if any tests are needed to make a correct
diagnosis.<br>

<br>
Work Relatedness<br>
A thorough work history is crucial to establishing work-relatedness. See Chapter
2 for components of the work history.<br>
Determining whether a complaint of a foot or ankle disorder is work
related requires careful analysis and weighing all associated or apparently causal
factors operative at the time (see Chapter 4). A predominance of work factors
suggests that worksite intervention is appropriate. A cluster of cases in a work
group suggests a greater probability of associated work-design or management
factors.<br>
Prolonged weight bearing may aggravate Morton’s neuroma, metatarsalgia,
hallux valgus, and plantar fasciitis, although the strength of the association
is not great. Acute trauma at work can be associated with tendinitis, tenosynovitis,
and ligament strains. Stress fractures can be related to a recent increase
in walking or weight-bearing activities. The relation of ‘‘chronic strain’’ or
degenerative joint disease to work in the absence of specific traumatic exposures
has not been documented in well-designed studies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Initial Care<br>
Comfort is often a patient’s first concern. Nonprescription analgesics, shorttermnon-
weight bearing, cold application and elevation will provide sufficient
pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute symptoms. If treatment
response is inadequate (e.g., if symptoms and activity limitations continue),
prescribed pharmaceuticals or physical methods can be added. Comorbid
conditions, side effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences guide the
clinician’s choice of recommendations. Table 14-3 summarizes initial treatment
options.<br>
<br>
<br>
Physical Methods<br>
<br>
Instruction in home exercise may be considered. Except for cases of
fractures, acute dislocations, or infection, patients may be advised to
do early passive range-of-motion exercises at home. Instruction in
proper exercise technique is important, and instruction by a physical
therapist can educate the patient about an effective exercise program.<br>
<br>
Patients may use applications of heat or cold at home before or after
exercises; these are as effective as those performed by a therapist.
Applying cold regularly for 36 to 48 hours following acute injury and
swelling is beneficial.<br>
<br>
Elevation and a brief period of non-weight bearing may be effective
for pain management and resolution of swelling.<br>
<br>
Manipulation has not been shown to be effective in alleviating foot
or ankle pain.<br>
<br>
Physical modalities, such as massage, diathermy, cutaneous laser treatment,
ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS)
units, and biofeedback have no scientifically proven efficacy in treating
acute ankle or foot symptoms, although some are used commonly in
conjunction with an active therapy program, such as therapeutic exercise.
Insufficient high quality scientific evidence exists to determine
clearly the effectiveness of these therapies.<br>
<br>
Limited evidence exists regarding extracorporeal shock wave therapy
(ESWT) in treating plantar fasciitis to reduce pain and improve function.
While it appears to be safe, there is disagreement as to its efficacy.
Insufficient high quality scientific evidence exists to determine clearly
the effectiveness of this therapy.<br>
<br>
Invasive techniques (e.g., needle acupuncture and injection procedures)
have no proven value, with the exception of corticosteroid
injection into the affected web space in patients with Morton’s neuroma
or into the affected area in patients with plantar fasciitis or heel
spur if four to six weeks of conservative therapy is ineffective.<br>
<br>
Other miscellaneous therapies have been evaluated and found to be
ineffective or minimally effective. In particular, iontophoresis and phonophoresis
have little or no proven efficacy in treating foot and ankle
complaints.<br>
<br>
Rigid orthotics (full-shoe-length inserts made to realign within the
foot and from foot to leg) may reduce pain experienced during walking
and may reduce more global measures of pain and disability for patients
with plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia.<br>
<br>
Night splints, as part of a treatment regimen that may include stretching,
range-of-motion (ROM) exercises and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), may be effective in treating plantar fasciitis,
though evidence is limited.<br>
<br>
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of impulse compression
or coupled electrical stimulation treatment to accelerate delayed fracture
union.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Table 14-3. Methods of Symptom Control for Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
RECOMMENDED<br>
Nonprescription Medications: Acetaminophen (safest), NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen)<br>
Physical Methods: Adjust or modify workstation, job tasks, or work hours and methods, Stretching, Specific foot and ankle exercises for range of motion and strengthening, At-home applications of cold during first few days of acute complaint; thereafter, applications of heat or cold as patient prefers, unless swelling persists—then use cold, Initial and follow-up visits for education, counseling, and evaluation of home exercise, Aerobic exercise<br>
Prescribed Pharmaceutical Methods: Other NSAIDs<br>
OPTIONS<br>
Ankle Sprain: Cold and elevation of foot, Splint or immobilization in severe cases, Gradual, early resumption of weight bearing as tolerated<br>
Tendinitis/Tenosynovitis: Splint, temporary cast or surgical shoe if needed<br>
Forefoot Sprain: Splint or surgical shoe if needed, Encourage partial weight bearing<br>
Neuroma: Toe separator at affected web space, Wide shoes<br>
Metatarsalgia: Metatarsal arch bars, Arch supports, Rigid orthotics<br>
Hallux Valgus: Soft, wide shoes<br>
Plantar Fasciitis: Heel donut, Soft, supportive shoes, Rigid orthotics<br>
Heel Spur: Heel donut, Air sole shoes<br>
Nonspecific Ankle or Foot Pain: Activity as tolerated<br>
Toe Fracture: Buddy taping, Splint or temporary cast if needed<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Activities<br>
Table 14-4 provides a guide for activity modification and duration of absence
from work. These recommendations apply to patients without comorbidity
or complicating factors, including employment or legal issues. They are targets
to provide a guide from the perspective of physiologic recovery. Key factors
to consider in disability duration are age and type of job, especially if the
regular work includes activities likely to worsen the condition. It is important
for the clinician to clarify with patients and employers that:<br>
Even moderately heavy weight bearing and carrying may aggravate
foot and ankle symptoms caused by tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, heel
spurs, metatarsalgia, and some other conditions.<br>
Any restrictions are intended to allow for spontaneous recovery or
time to build activity tolerance through exercise.<br>
<br>
<br>
Follow-up Visits<br>
Patients with ankle and foot complaints may have initial follow-up every three
to five days by a midlevel practitioner or physical therapist who can provide
counseling about avoiding static positions, medication use, activity modification,
and other concerns. Care should be taken to answer questions and make
these sessions interactive so that the patient is fully involved in his or her
recovery. If the patient has returned to work, these interactions may be done on
site or by telephone to avoid interfering with modified- or full-work activities.<br>
Physician follow-up is appropriate when a release to modified-, increased-,
or full-duty work is needed, or after appreciable healing or recovery is expected.
Later physician follow-up might be expected every four to seven days if the
patient is off work and every seven to fourteen days if the patient is working.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations<br>
For most cases presenting with true foot and ankle disorders, special studies
are usually not needed until after a period of conservative care and observation.
Most ankle and foot problems improve quickly once any red-flag issues are
ruled out. Routine testing, i.e., laboratory tests, plain-film radiographs of the
foot or ankle, and special imaging studies are not recommended during the
first month of activity limitation, except when a red flag noted on history or
examination raises suspicion of a dangerous foot or ankle condition or of
referred pain.<br>
<br>
In particular, patients who have suffered ankle injuries caused by a mechanism
that could result in fracture can have radiographs if the Ottawa Criteria
are met. This will markedly increase the diagnostic yield for plain radiography.
The Ottawa Criteria are rules for foot and ankle radiographic series. An ankle
radiographic series is indicated if the patient is experiencing any pain in the:<br>
Malleolar area, and any of the following findings apply: a) tenderness
at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral malleolus; b) tenderness at
the posterior edge or tip of the medial malleolus; or c) inability to
bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department.<br>
Midfoot area, and any of the following findings apply: a) tenderness
at the base of the fifth metatarsal; b) tenderness at the navicular bone;
or c) inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency
department.<br>
<br>
Radiographic evaluation may also be performed if there is rapid onset of
swelling and bruising; if patient’s age exceeds 55 years; if the injury is highvelocity;
in the case of multiple injury or obvious dislocation/subluxation; or
if the patient cannot bear weight for more than four steps.<br>
For patients with continued limitations of activity after four weeks of
symptoms and unexplained physical findings such as effusion or localized pain,
especially following exercise, imaging may be indicated to clarify the diagnosis
and assist reconditioning. Stress fractures may have a benign appearance, but
point tenderness over the bone is indicative of the diagnosis and a radiograph
or a bone scan may be ordered. Imaging findings should be correlated with
physical findings.<br>
Disorders of soft tissue (such as tendinitis, metatarsalgia, fasciitis, and
neuroma) yield negative radiographs and do not warrant other studies, e.g.,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging may be
helpful to clarify a diagnosis such as osteochondritis dissecans in cases of
delayed recovery.<br>
Cases of hallux valgus that fail conservative treatment merit standing plain
films to plan surgery, and consultation with the potential surgeon is recommended.
Sprains are frequently seen after emergency room treatment in which
radiographs are obtained to rule out fractures. Minimal sprains can be treated
symptomatically without films. Table 14-5 provides a general comparison of
the abilities of different techniques to identify physiologic insult and define
anatomic defects.<br>

Surgical Considerations<br>
Referral for surgical consultation may be indicated for patients who have:<br>
Activity limitation for more than one month without signs of functional
improvement<br>
Failure of exercise programs to increase range of motion and strength
of the musculature around the ankle and foot<br>
Clear clinical and imaging evidence of a lesion that has been shown
to benefit in both the short and long term from surgical repair<br>
<br>
Earlier, emergency consultation is reserved for patients who may require
drainage of acute effusions or hematomas. Referral for early repair of ligament
tears is controversial and not common practice. Repairs are generally reserved
for chronic instability. Most patients have satisfactory results with physical
rehabilitation and thus avoid the risks of surgery. If there is no clear indication
for surgery, referring the patient to a physical medicine practitioner may help
resolve the symptoms.<br>
<br>
A. Neuroma<br>
If a patient with a neuroma has persistent pain in a web space despite using
toe separators, along with temporary relief from local cortisone injections,
surgical removal of the neuroma may be indicated. Besides the usual counseling
about possible wound complications and complications of anesthesia, the
patient can be informed that the operation is not always effective because the
surgeon may be unable to find the neuroma and excise it. Always counsel
the patient about expectations for surgery so that he or she can make an
informed decision about whether or not to proceed with surgery.<br>
<br>
B. Hallux Valgus<br>
Failure of conservative treatment (e.g., using wider shoes and/or arch supports,
or aspiration of an overlying bursa) may lead to consideration of surgery.
However, surgery should not be performed for cosmetic purposes because surgical
complications such as infection can worsen appearance and a good
functional result is the goal of treatment. Counseling patients about the
postoperative course and recovery period is required because they may otherwise
underestimate the length of time for recovery and the postoperative pain
involved.<br>

Chapter 14 - Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
Table 14-6 Summary of Recommendation for Evaluating and Managing Ankle and Foot Complaints<br>
<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Physical treatment methods<br>
Recommended:  For acute injuries, at-home ice applications, range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, as taught by primary provider (D)<br>
Optional:  Pneumatic or pulse devices to reduce swelling (C), ESWT for plantar fasciitis (C), Coupled electrical stimulation or impulse compression for fracture (C)<br>
Not Recommended:  Passive physical therapy modalities, except as initial aid prior to home exercises (D), Laser treatment (B)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Medication<br>
Recommended:  Acetaminophen (C), NSAIDs (B)<br>
Optional:  Opioids, short course (C), NSAID creams (D)<br>
Recommended:  Use of opioids for more than 2 weeks (C)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Injections<br>
Recommended:  For patients with point tenderness in the area of a heel spur, plantar fasciitis, or Morton’s neuroma, local injection of lidocaine and cortisone solution (D)<br>
Not Recommended:  Repeated or frequent injections (D)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Rest and immobilization (e.g., braces, supports)<br>
Recommended:  For acute injuries, immobilization and weight bearing as tolerated; taping or bracing later to avoid exacerbation or for prevention (C), For acute swelling, rest and elevation (D), For appropriate diagnoses, rigid orthotics, metatarsal bars, heel donut, toe separator (C)<br>
Optional:  Tension night splints for plantar fasciitis (B)<br>
Not Recommended:  Prolonged supports or bracing without exercise (due to risk of debilitation) (D)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Detection of physiologic abnormalities<br>
Not Recommended:  Electrical studies for routine foot and ankle problems without clinical evidence of tarsal tunnel syndrome or other entrapment neuropathies (D)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Radiography<br>
Recommended:  Plain-film radiographs only for patients with acute ankle injuries who have signs identified in Ottawa Criteria ankle rules (B), further evaluation if radiographic films show ankle effusion > 13 mm anteriorly (C)<br>
Not Recommended:  Routine plain-film radiographs for ankle injuries (B), Routine radiographic films for soft tissue diagnoses (D)<br>
<br>
Clinical Measure:  Surgical considerations<br>
Recommended:  Bunionectomy if conservative treatment fails and radiographs are positive for > 14-degree intermetatarsal angle (D), Excision of neuroma if conservative treatment (injections, toe separator) fails (D), Reconstruction of lateral ankle ligament for symptomatic patients with ankle laxity demonstrated on physical exam and positive stress films (C)<br>
Not Recommended:  Diagnostic arthroscopy of ankle if diagnosis obtainable by other non-invasive method (D), Arthroscopy of ankle for synovial impingement before conservative care, including injections, is tried (D)<br>
