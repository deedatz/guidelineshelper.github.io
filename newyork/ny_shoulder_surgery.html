	D SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES, TESTING AND TREATMENT PROCEDURES<br><br>

	D.1 ACROMIOCLAVICULAR (AC) JOINT SPRAINS/DISLOCATIONS<br> 
	An acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint injury is frequently referred to as a shoulder separation.<br>
	Classification of Injury: The degree of clavicular displacement depends on the severity of injury to the AC and Coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments, the AC joint capsule, and the supporting muscles of the shoulder (trapezius and deltoid) that attach to the clavicle.<br> 
	The traditional Allman and Tossy classification is a 3-grade classification scheme. Rockwood expanded that classification to 6 types of injury. The<br>
	Rockwood Type I injury corresponds to the original Allman/Tossy Grade I;<br>
	Rockwood Type II to the original Allman/Tossy Grade II and Rockwood<br>
	Types III-VI are in the original Grade III Allman/Tossy category.<br>
	The Allman/Tossy classification and the corresponding Rockwood classification are illustrated in Table 1:<br>
	Table 1: Allman/Tossy â€“ Rockwood Classification Systems<br>
	Allman Rockwood<br>
	Grade I: Type I: Partial disruption of the AC ligament and capsule.<br>
	Grade II: Type II: Sprains consisting of a ruptured AC ligament and capsule with incomplete injury to the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament, resulting in minimal AC Joint subluxation.<br>
	Grade III: Type III: Separation or complete tearing of the AC ligament and/or CC ligaments, possible deltoid trapezius fascial injury, and dislocation of the AC Joint.<br>
	OR<br>
	Type IV: Dislocation consisting of a displaced clavicle that penetrates posteriorly through or into the trapezius muscle.<br>
	OR<br>
	Type V: Dislocation consisting of complete separation of the AC and CC ligaments and dislocation of the AC joint with a large CC interval.<br>
	OR<br>
	Type VI: Dislocation consisting of a displaced clavicle that penetrates inferior to the coracoid.<br>
	Types I-III are common, while Types IV-VI are not and, when found, require surgical consultation. For AC joint degeneration from repetitive motion that is found to be work-related, see Impingement Syndrome.<br>
	D.1.f Operative Procedures (AC Joint Sprains/Dislocations)<br>
	D.1.f.i With a Type III AC joint injury, an appropriate orthopedic consultation could be considered initially, but should be considered when conservative care fails to increase function.<br>
	D.1.f.ii With a Type IV-VI AC joint injury, an orthopedic surgical consultation is recommended.<br>
	D.1.g Post-Operative Procedures (AC Joint Sprains/Dislocations) <br>
	These should be coordinated by the orthopedic and the primary care physician working with the interdisciplinary team. Keeping with the therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures found in this Shoulder Guide, the patient could be immobilized for 2-3 weeks, restricted in activities, both work-related and avocational, for 6-8 weeks while undergoing rehabilitation, and be expected to progress to return to full duty based upon his/her response to rehabilitation and the demands of the job.<br><br>

	D.2 ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS/FROZEN SHOULDER DISORDER<br>
	Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder, also known as frozen shoulder disorder, is a soft tissue lesion of the glenohumeral joint resulting in restrictions of passive and active range of motion. Occupational adhesive capsulitis arises secondarily to any chest or upper extremity trauma. It may also occur following stroke, traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury among other etiologies. Primary adhesive capsulitis is rarely occupational in origin. The disorder goes through stages, specifically:<br>
	Stage 1: Consists of acute pain with some limitation in range of motion; generally lasting 2-9 months.<br>
	Stage 2: Characterized by progressive stiffness, loss of range of motion, and muscular atrophy; it may last an additional 4-12 months beyond Stage 1.<br>
	Stage 3: Characterized by partial or complete resolution of symptoms and restoration of range of motion and strength; it usually takes an additional 6-9 months beyond Stage 2.<br>
	D.2.a History and Mechanism of Injury (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder)<br>
	D.2.a.i Mechanism of Injury: There often is some history of prior injury. Often adhesive capsulitis is seen with impingement syndrome or other shoulder disorders; refer to appropriate subsection of this guideline. D.2.a.ii Patient will usually complain of pain in the sub-deltoid region, but occasionally over the long head of the biceps or radiating down the lateral aspect of the arm to the forearm. Pain is often worse at night with difficulty sleeping on the involved side. Motion is restricted and painful.<br>
	D.2.f Operative Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder)<br>
	For cases failing conservative therapy of at least 3-6 months duration and which are significantly limited in range of motion (abduction less than 90 ), the following operative procedure may be considered:<br>
	D.2.f.i Manipulation Under General Anesthesia (MUA) is indicated in cases of intractable restriction, and may be performed by a duly qualified surgeon. It may be done in combination with steroid injection or distension arthrography.<br>
	D.2.g Post-Operative Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist.<br>
	D.2.g.i Early and aggressive physical medicine interventions are recommended to maintain range of motion and progress strengthening; return to work with restrictions after surgery should be discussed with the treating provider. The patient should be approaching MMI within 8-12 weeks post-operative; however, coexistence of other pathology should be taken into consideration.<br><br>

	D.3 BICIPITAL TENDON DISORDERS<br>
	Bicipital Tendon disorders may include 1) primary bicipital tendonitis, which is exceedingly rare; 2) secondary bicipital tendinitis which is generally associated with rotator cuff tendinitis or impingement syndrome (refer to the appropriate diagnosis subsections); 3) subluxation of the biceps tendon which occurs with dysfunction of the transverse intertubercular ligament and massive rotator cuff tears; and 4) acute disruption of the tendon, which can result from an acute distractive force or transection of the tendon from direct trauma. Evaluation of the elbow may be required when evaluating bicipital tendon injury.<br>
	D.3.f Operative Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders)<br>
	D.3.f.i Bicipital Tendinitis: Conservative care prior to potential surgery must address flexibility and strength imbalances.<br>
	Surgical remedies would be considered after 12 weeks of appropriate conservative care has failed. Since impingement of the biceps tendon could cause continued irritation, an acromioplasty may be necessary, especially when the presence of an obstructing osteophyte is demonstrated on plain x-rays .<br>
	D.3.f.ii Subluxing Bicipital Tendon: The decision to surgically stabilize the bicipital tendon is not commonly indicated. In the vast majority of cases, optimal outcome is achieved through successful rehabilitation procedures, and appropriate non-surgical measures should be maximized prior to surgical intervention.<br>
	D.3.f.iii Acute Disruption of the Bicipital Tendon:<br> 
	Surgery has been shown to be more effective than conservative care in the treatment of full thickness ruptures of the distal biceps tendon.<br>
	D.3.g Post-Operative Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders) would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Rehabilitation, lasting 6-12 weeks, is necessary to facilitate maximum medical improvement (MMI).<br><br>

	D.4 BRACHIOPLEXUS INJURIES<br>
	Brachioplexus Injuries to the nerves and shoulder girdle region result in loss of motor and sensory function, pain and instability of the shoulder. Signs and symptoms vary with the mechanism of injury. The two modes of injury are: 1) acute direct trauma, and 2) repetitive motion or overuse. Transient compression, stretch or traction (neuropraxia) causes sensory and motor signs lasting days to weeks. Damage to the axon (axonomesis) without disruption of the nerve framework may cause similar symptoms.<br>
	The recovery time is delayed and depends upon axon regrowth distally from the site of injury. Laceration or disruption of the entire nerve with complete loss of framework (neurotmesis) is the most severe form of nerve injury. Return of function is dependent upon regrowth of the nerve distal to the injury site. <br><br>
	D.4.a Brachial Plexus<br>
	Brachial Plexus is formed by the nerve roots of C5-C8 and T1; these nerve roots exit the cervical spine and pass through the scalene musculature; after leaving the scalene musculature, at the level of the clavicle, they form trunks, divisions and chords which ultimately form the peripheral nerves of the arm.<br>
	D.4.a.vi Operative Procedures (Brachial Plexus): For open injuries, exploration may be worthwhile if there is poor progression of recovery from a conservative approach; for closed injuries, if progressive weakness and loss of function is documented after 4-6 months of conservative care, then exploration is also warranted. <br>
	D.4.a.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Brachial Plexus) would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, surgeon and therapist. This program would begin with 4-6 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br><br>

	D.4.b Axillary Nerve<br>
	Axillary Nerve is derived from the 5th and 6th cervical roots. It passes around the shoulder and supplies motor branches to the teres minor and the three heads of the deltoid; it gives sensation to the lateral aspect of the proximal arm at the level of the deltoid.<br>
	b.vi Operative Procedures (Axillary Nerve)<br>
	Operative Procedures are usually not necessary, since most injuries to the axillary nerve are due to stretch and/or traction. One may consider surgery after 4-6 months with electro diagnostic studies documenting ongoing enervation and loss of function.<br>
	D.4.b.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Axillary Nerve)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 4-6 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br><br>

	D.4.c Long Thoracic Nerve<br>
	Long Thoracic Nerve is formed by the cervical fifth, sixth, and seventh roots; it crosses the border of the first rib and descends along the posterior surface of the thoracic wall to the stratus anterior.<br>
	D.4.c.vi Operative Procedures (Long Thoracic Nerve) <br>
	Operative Procedure such as scapular fixation may be recommended, but only in the most severe cases where there is documented significant loss of function.<br>
	D.4.c.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Long Thoracic Nerve)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures should include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 8-10 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br><br>

	D.4.d Musculocutaneous Nerve<br>
	Musculocutaneous Nerve is derived from the fifth and sixth cervical roots; it innervates the coracobrachialis, biceps and brachialis muscles and also provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the forearm. Trauma (including surgery) or penetrating wound to the brachial plexus, coracobrachialis, and shoulder often can cause nerve injury. <br>
	D.4.d.vi Operative Procedures (Musculocutaneous Nerve)<br>
	Operative Procedures are usually not necessary unless there has been increasing loss of function over 4-6 months and/or a laceration to the nerve has been identified.<br>
	D.4.d.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Musculocutaneous Nerve)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedure would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 8-10 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br>

	D.4.e Spinal Accessory Nerve<br>
	Spinal Accessory Nerve is the eleventh cranial nerve; the nerve innervates the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles which are extremely important for scapular control and ultimately shoulder function.<br>
	D.4.e.vi Operative Procedures (Spinal Accessory Nerve)<br>
	Operative Procedures are usually not necessary unless increased loss of function over 4-6 months has been documented and/or a laceration to the nerve has been identified.<br>
	D.4.e.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Spinal Accessory Nerve)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 8-10 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br><br>

	D.4.f Suprascapular Nerve<br>
	Suprascapular Nerve is derived from the fifth and sixth cervical root, superior trunk of the brachial plexus, and it innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles of the rotator cuff.<br>
	D.4.f.vi Operative Treatment Procedures (Suprascapular Nerve)<br>
	Operative Treatment involving surgical release at the suprascapular notch or spinoglenoid region is warranted depending upon the results of the electrodiagnostic studies and/or absence of improvement with conservative management.<br>
	D.4.f.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Suprascapular Nerve)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 8-10 weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength.<br><br>

	D.5 BURSITIS OF THE SHOULDER<br>
	Acute or chronic inflammation of the bursa (a potential fluid filled sac) that may be caused by trauma, chronic overuse, inflammatory arthritis, and acute or chronic infection that generally presents with localized pain and tenderness of the shoulder.<br>
	D.5.f Operative Procedures (Bursitis of the Shoulder)<br>
	Operative Procedures are not commonly indicated for pure bursitis.<br><br>

	D.6 IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME<br>
	A collection of symptoms, not a pathologic diagnosis. The symptoms result from the encroachment of the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, coracoid process, and/or the AC joint on the rotator cuff mechanism that passes beneath them as the shoulder is moved. The cuff mechanism is intimately related to the coracoacromial arch. Separated only by the thin lubricating surfaces of the bursa, compression and friction can be minimized by several factors, such as:<br>
	Shape of the coracoacromial arch that allows passage of the subjacent rotator cuff;<br>
	Normal undersurface of the AC joint;<br>
	Normal bursa;<br>
	Normal capsular laxity; and<br>
	Coordinated scapulothoracic function.<br>
	The impingement syndrome may be associated with AC joint arthritis and both partial- and full-thickness rotator cuff tears, as well as adhesive capsulitis/frozen shoulder. Normal function of the rotator cuff mechanism and biceps tendon assist to diminish impingement syndrome.<br>
	D.6.f Operative Procedures (Impingement Syndrome)<br>
	Operative Procedures for impingement syndrome should not be considered prior to an adequate trial of physical rehabilitation that includes direction and supervision by an appropriate, licensed professional and active patient participation. Such a trial should normally last for a minimum of 6 weeks. Refer to <br>
	Table 2: Criteria for Shoulder Surgery - Impingement Syndrome.<br>
	If the patient has<br>
	DIAGNOSIS: <br>
	Acromial Impingement Syndrome (80% of these patients will get better without surgery) AND the diagnosis is supported by<br>
	CLINICAL FINDING<br>
	SUBJECTIVE <br>
	Pain with active arc motion 90 - 130Â° AND Pain at night; Tenderness over the greater tuberosity is common in acute cases.<br>
	OBJECTIVE<br>
	Weak or absent abduction. May also demonstrate atrophy AND Tenderness over rotator cuff or anterior acromial area AND Positive Impingement sign and temporary relief of pain with anesthetic injection (diagnostic injection test).<br>
	IMAGING <br>
	Conventional x-rays , AP, and true lateral or axillary view AND MRI, Ultrasound Or Arthrogram shows positive evidence of deficit in rotator cuff. <br>
	AND this has been done (if recommended)<br>
	CONSERVATIVE CARE<br>
	Recommend 3-6 months: three months is adequate if treatment has been continuous, six months if treatment has been intermittent. Treatment must be directed toward gaining full range of motion, which requires both stretching and strengthening to balance the musculature.<br>
	The following surgery may be appropriate <br>
	SURGICAL PROCEDURE <br>
	Anterior Acromioplasty<br>
	D.6.g Post-Operative Procedures (Impingement Syndrome) <br>
	D.6.g.i Individualized rehabilitation programs based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist might include:<br>
	(a) Sling or abduction splint;<br>
	(b) Gentle pendulum exercise, passive glenohumeral range of motion and aggressive posterior scapular stabilizing training can be instituted;<br>
	(c) At 4 weeks post-operative, begin isometrics and ADL involvement; and/or<br>
	(d) Depending upon the patient's functional response, at 6 weeks post-operative consider beginning light resistive exercise; concomitantly, return to a light/modified duty may be plausible given the ability to accommodate "no repetitive overhead activities."<br>
	D.6.g.ii Progressive resistive exercise from 2 months with gradual returning to full activity at 5-7 months; all active nonoperative procedures listed in Section D, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures, should be considered.<br>
	D.6.g.iii Work restrictions should be evaluated every 4-6 weeks during post-operative recovery and rehabilitation with appropriate written communications to both the patient and the employer. Should progress plateau, the provider should reevaluate the patient's condition and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan.<br><br>

	D.7 ROTATOR CUFF TEARS<br>
	Partial or full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff tendons, most often the supraspinatus, can be caused by vascular, traumatic or degenerative factors or a combination. Further tear classification includes: a small tear is less than 1 cm; medium tear is 1-3 cm; large tear is 3-5 cm; and massive tear is greater than 5 cm, usually with retraction.<br>
	D.7.f Operative Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tear)<br>
	Refer to Table 3, Criteria for Shoulder Surgery â€“ Rotator Cuff Tear.<br>

	Table 3: Criteria for Shoulder Surgery â€“ Rotator Cuff Tear<br>

	SURGICAL PROCEDURE <br>
	Rotator Cuff Repair OR Anterior Acromioplasty<br>

	D.7.g Post-Operative Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tear)<br>
	D.7.g.i Individualized rehabilitation program based on communication among the physician, the surgeon and therapist might include:<br>
	(a) Sling or abduction splint;<br>
	(b) Gentle pendulum exercise, passive glenohumeral range of motion in flexion and external rotation to prevent adhesions and maintain mobilization;<br>

	D.7.g.iii Work restrictions should be evaluated every 4-6 weeks during post-operative recovery and rehabilitation with appropriate written communications to both the patient and employer. Should progress plateau, the provider should reevaluate the patient's condition and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan.<br><br>

	D.8 ROTATOR CUFF TENDINITIS<br>
	Inflammation of one or more of the four musculotendinous structures which arise from the scapula and insert on the lesser or greater tuberosity of the humerus. These structures include one internal rotator (subscapularis), and two external rotators (infraspinatus and teres minor), and the supraspinatus which assists in abduction.<br>
	D.8.f Operative Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tendinitis)<br>
	Operative Procedures are not indicated for this diagnosis.<br><br>

	D.9 SHOULDER FRACTURES<br>
	There are five common types of shoulder fractures. Each type will be addressed separately and in the order of most frequent occurrence.<br><br>

	D.9.a Clavicular Fracture<br>
	D.9.a.vi Operative Procedures (Clavicular Fracture)<br>
	Operative Procedures would be indicated for open fractures, vascular or neural injuries requiring repair, bilateral fractures, ipsilateral scapular or glenoid neck fractures, scapulothoracic dislocations, flail chest and nonunion displaced-closed fractures that show no evidence of union after 4-6 months. Also a Type II fracture/dislocation at the AC joint where the distal clavicular fragment remains with the acromion and the coracoid, and the large proximal fragment is displaced upwards.<br>
	D.9.a.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Clavicular Fracture)<br>
	Post-Operative procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with 2-3 weeks of rest with a shoulder immobilizer while encouraging isometric deltoid strengthening; pendulum exercises with progression to assisted forward flexion and external rotation would follow; strengthening exercises should be started at 10-12 weeks.<br><br>

	D.9.b Proximal Humeral Fracture<br>
	D.9.b.vi Operative Procedures (Proximal Humeral Fracture) <br>
	Indications for operative treatment would include:<br>
	(a) Unstable surgical neck fractures (no contact between the fracture fragments).<br>
	(b) Partially unstable fractures (only partial contact) with associated same upper extremity injuries.<br>
	(c) Displaced 3 and 4 part fractures may be managed by a prosthetic hemiarthroplasty and reattachment of the tuberosities.<br>
	D.9.b.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Proximal Humeral Fracture)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, surgeon and therapist.<br>
	(a) Refer to Section D.9.b.v, Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative, Proximal Humeral Fracture.<br>
	(b) Schanz pins are removed from the greater tuberosity fragment at 2-3 weeks.<br> 
	(c) Shanz pins across the humeral neck are removed at 4-6 weeks.<br><br>

	D.9.c Humeral Shaft Fracture<br>
	D.9.c.vi Operative Procedures (Humeral Shaft Fracture)<br>
	Indications for operative care would include:<br>
	(a) Open fracture;<br>
	(b) Associated forearm or elbow fracture (i.e., the floating elbow injury);<br>
	(c) Burned upper extremity;<br>
	(d) Associated paraplegia;<br>
	(e) Multiple injuries (polytrauma);<br>
	(f) A radial nerve palsy which came on after closed reduction; and/or<br>
	(g) Pathologic fracture related to an occupational injury.<br>
	Accepted methods of internal fixation include:<br>
	(a) A broad plate and screws; and/or<br>
	(b) Intramedullary rodding with or without crosslocking screws.<br>
	D.9.c.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Humeral Shaft Fracture) <br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Following rigid internal fixation, therapy may be started to obtain passive and later active shoulder motion using appropriate therapeutic approaches as seen in Section D.9.c.v, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures, Humeral Shaft Fracture. Active elbow and wrist motion may be started immediately.<br><br>

	D.9.d Scapular Fracture<br>
	D.9.d.vi Operative Treatment (Scapular Fracture)<br>
	(a) Acromial fractures which are displaced should be internally fixed to prevent a nonunion. These fractures may be fixed with lagged screws and a superiorly placed plate to neutralize the muscular forces.<br>
	(b) Glenoid fractures which are displaced greater than 2-3 mm should be fixed internally. The approach is determined by studying the results of a CT scan.<br>
	(c) Scapular body fractures require internal fixation if the lateral or medial borders are displaced to such a degree as to interfere with scapulothoracic motion.<br> 
	(d) Displaced fractures of the scapular neck and the ipsilateral clavicle require internal fixation of the clavicle to reduce the scapular neck fracture.<br>
	D.9.d.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Scapular Fracture)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. A shoulder immobilizer is utilized, pendulum exercises at one week, deltoid isometric exercises are started early, and, at 4-6 weeks, active range of motion is commenced.<br><br>

	D.9.e Sternoclavicular Dislocation/Fracture<br>
	D.9.e.vi Operative Procedures (Sternoclavicular Dislocation/Fracture)<br>
	Operative Procedures are not recommended.<br><br>

	D.10 SHOULDER INSTABILITY<br>
	D.10.f Operative Procedures (Shoulder Instability)<br>
	D.10.f.i Identify causative agent for the instability (i.e., labral detachment, bony lesion, or multidirectional instability), then proceed with:<br>
	(a) Bony block transfer;<br>
	(b) Capsular tightening; or<br>
	(c) Bankart lesion repair.<br>
	D.10.g Post-Operative Procedures (Shoulder Instability)<br>
	Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Depending upon the type of surgery, the patient will be immobilized for 3-6 weeks. As soon as it is safe to proceed without damaging the repair, progressive therapy with consultation involving an occupational and/or physical therapist should begin with therapeutic exercise, physical medicine and rehabilitation. During this period of time, the patient could resume working when:<br>
	D.10.g.i Medications which would predispose to injury are no longer being prescribed or used; and<br>
	D.10.g.ii The treating physician has cleared the patient for the specific vocational activities.<br><br>

	D.11 SUPERIOR LABRUM ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR (SLAP) LESIONS<br>
	D.11.f Operative Procedures (SLAP lesion) <br>
	Operative treatment of SLAP lesions depends on the type of lesion present and whether any other intra-articular abnormalities are present. The following are generally accepted protocols for surgical intervention. <br>
	D.11.f.i Type I: Debridement is reasonable but not required;<br>
	D.11.f.ii Type II: Repair via suture anchors or biceps tenotomy are reasonable options;<br>
	D.11.f.iii Type III: Debridement or excision of the bucket handle component alone or repair via suture anchors or biceps tenotomy/tenodesis are reasonable options;<br>
	D.11.f.iv Type IV: Debridement and/or biceps tenotomy or tenodesis are reasonable options.<br>
	D.11.g Post-Operative Treatment (SLAP lesion)<br>
	Post-operative rehabilitation programs should be individualized and dependent upon whether any other intra-articular abnormalities exist and were operatively treated. There is a paucity of information on rehabilitation of isolated SLAP lesions. Common post-operative care involves wearing a sling, without active shoulder motion for 4 to 6 weeks. Elbow, wrist, and hand range-of-motion (ROM) exercises may be used at this time. The sling is removed at 4 to 6 weeks and active ROM is usually begun with restrictions directed by the surgeon. It is reasonable to restrict external rotation and abduction up to six months post-operative.<br><br>
