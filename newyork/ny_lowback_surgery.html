	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: OPERATIVE<br><br>
	E.1 Discectomy, Microdiscectomy, Sequestrectomy, Endoscopic Decompression<br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.1.a.i Lumbar discectomy is recommended as an effective operation to speed recovery in patients who have radiculopathy due to ongoing nerve root compression, who continue to have significant pain and functional limitation after 6 to 12 weeks and who have been provided appropriate conservative therapy during which time they experienced no progressive neurological deficits. <br>
	E.1.a.ii All of the following should be present: 1) radicular pain syndrome with current dermatomal pain and/or numbness, or myotomal muscle weakness - consistent with a herniated disc at the corresponding level; 2) imaging findings by MRI or CT with/out myelography that confirm persisting nerve root compression at the level and on the side predicted by the history and clinical examination; 3) continued significant pain and functional limitation after 6 to 12 weeks and who have been provided appropriate conservative therapy during which time they experienced no progressive neurological deficits. <br>
	Patients who are candidates for discectomy should be informed that (other than for cauda equina syndrome and the rare progressive major neurologic deficit), there is evidence that there is no need to rush surgical decisions, since there is no difference in long-term functional recovery whether surgery is performed early or delayed. Open discectomy, microdiscectomy, and endoscopic discectomy are all potentially appropriate ways to perform discectomy. The decision as to which of these procedures to choose should be left to the surgeon and the patient, until quality evidence becomes available to provide evidence-based guidance. <br>
	E.1.a.iii Discectomy is not recommended as treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic back pain without radiculopathy. <br>
	E.1.a.iv Percutaneous discectomy (nucleoplasty), laser discectomy, and disc coblation therapy are not recommended as treatment for any back or radicular pain syndrome. <br><br>

	E.2 ADHESIOLYSIS <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.2.a.i Adhesiolysis is not recommended for acute, subacute, or chronic back pain, spinal stenosis, or radicular pain syndromes.<br> <br>

	E.3 DECOMPRESSIVE SURGERY (LAMINOTOMY/FACETECTOMY, LAMINECTOMY) <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.3.a.i Decompression surgery is recommended as an effective treatment for patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis (neurogenic claudication) that is intractable to conservative management. <br><br>

	E.4 SPINAL FUSION <br>
	Lumbar Fusion is not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.4.a.i Lumbar fusion is recommended as a treatment for spinal stenosis when concomitant instability has been proven. Lumbar fusion is not recommended for spinal stenosis without instability. <br>
	Indications: All of the following should be present: 1) neurogenic claudication (leg pain and/or numbness with standing or walking); 2) imaging findings, by MRI, or CT/myelogram that confirm the nerve roots compressed are consistent with the neurological symptoms; 3) lack of responsiveness or unsatisfactory response(s) to adequate conservative treatment over a minimum 6 to 8 week period that may or may not include an epidural steroid injection. <br>
	E.4.a.ii Lumbar fusion is recommended as an effective treatment for isthmic spondylolisthesis. <br>
	E.4.a.iii Lumbar fusion is recommended as an effective treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis. <br>
	E.4.a.iv There are no scientific studies, but consensus is that if a patient is having the third lumbar discectomy on the same disc, that spine fusion at the time of discectomy is an option. <br>
	E.4.a.v Lumbar fusion is not recommended as a treatment for patients with radiculopathy from herniated nucleus pulposus (disc herniation) or for patients with chronic back pain after lumbar discectomy. <br>
	E.4.a.vi Lumbar fusion is recommended as a treatment for Degenerative Disc Disease/“Discogenic Back Pain”/“Black Disc Disease” without instability in selected patients for whom non-surgical management has failed to relieve symptoms and improve function (WCB). If available, an intensive Functional Rehabilitation Program should be tried first. <br><br>

	E.5 ELECTRICAL BONE GROWTH STIMULATORS <br>
	Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure.<br>
	Recommendations 
	E.5.a.i Non invasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators (WCB) as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery for those at high risk for pseudoarthrosis, including one or more of the following fusion failure risk factors: <br>
	1) One or more previous failed spinal fusion(s) <br>
	2) Grade II or worse spondylolisthesis <br>
	3) Fusion to be performed at more than one level <br>
	4) Presence of other risk factors that may contribute to non-healing: <br>
	Current smoking <br>
	Diabetes <br>
	Renal disease <br>
	Other metabolic diseases where bone healing is likely to be compromised (e.g.: significant osteoporosis) <br>
	Active alcoholism <br>
	Morbid obesity BMI >40 <br>
	E.5.a.ii Non-invasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators (WCB) may be considered as treatment for individuals with failed spinal fusion. Failed spinal fusion is defined as a spinal fusion that has not healed at a minimum of 6 months after the original surgery, as evidenced by serial x-rays over a course of 3 months during the latter portion of the 6 month period.<br> <br>

	E.6 DISC REPLACEMENT<br> 	
	Artificial Disc Replacement is not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.6.a.i Artificial disc replacement (WCB) is recommended as treatment for lumbar degenerative disc disease at one level with radiculopathy that is unresponsive to conservative management. <br>
	The following criteria must be met: <br>
	1. Skeletally mature patient without renal failure, severe diabetes, osteoporosis, severe spondylosis, severe facet pathology, lumbar instability, localized fracture, or localized or systemic infections. <br>
	AND <br>
	2. Single-level disc degeneration of L3 to S1 confirmed by imaging studies such as CT or MRI, with one of the following diagnoses: <br>
	-Herniated disc; or<br> 
	-Osteophyte formation; or<br> 
	-Loss of disc height.<br> 
	AND<br>
	3. The patient must present with symptoms, which must correspond with the planned level of disc replacement:<br> 
	-Intractable radiculopathy (nerve root compression) and/or myelopathy (functional disturbance or pathological change in the spinal cord) causing radicular pain in the lower extremity; or<br> 
	-Functional and/or neurological deficit.<br> 
	AND<br>	
	4. Six weeks of non-operative alternative treatments have failed. These treatments may include physical therapy, medications, braces, chiropractic care, bed rest, spinal injections or exercise programs. Documentation of treatments and failure to improve is required.<br>
	The disc must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All other artificial disc systems are considered experimental and investigational.<br> 
	All other indications, including multilevel degenerative disc disease, are considered experimental and investigational.<br> 
	Artificial disc replacement is NOT recommended under the following conditions, since safety and effectiveness of the replacement discs has not been established for patients with:<br>
	-Previous surgical intervention at the involved level;<br>
	-Prior or proposed fusion at an adjacent cervical level;<br> 
	-More than one lumbar level requiring artificial disc replacement;<br> 
	-Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the affected level due to current or past trauma (including but not limited to the radiographic appearance of fracture callus, malunion or nonunion).<br>	
	-Active systemic infection or infection at the operating site;<br>	
	-Allergy to titanium, polyurethane, or ethylene oxide residues;<br> 
	-Osteoporosis defined as a DEXA bone mineral density T score equal to or worse than -2.5.<br><br> 
	E.7 VERTEBROPLASTY AND KYPHOPLASTY<br>	
	Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure.<br> 
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.7.a.i Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty (WCB) may be considered for treatment of select patients with vertebral body compression fractures with associated chronic or severe pain. Patients who have had fractures despite bisphosphonate therapy are particularly appropriate candidates. Recent placebo-controlled studies have questioned the efficacy of vertebroplasty, and the evidence warranting this recommendation will be monitored closely. <br><br>

	E.8 SACROILIAC SURGERY <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.8.a.i SI joint fusion surgery and other SI joint surgical procedures are not recommended. <br><br>

	E.10 IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATORS <br>
	Spinal Cord Stimulators are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. <br>
	Recommendations: <br>
	E.10.a.i Spinal cord stimulators (WCB) are recommended for treatment of selected patients with chronic back pain, specifically patients with failed back surgery syndrome, i.e. who have persistent severe and disabling back pain despite having been provided with conventional non-surgical treatments and having undergone surgical treatment that failed to relieve symptoms and improve function and no other treatment options are available. If available, an intensive Functional Rehabilitation Program should be tried before the use of a spinal cord stimulator. No patient can undergo insertion of a spinal cord stimulator before a thorough psychological evaluation indicates that there are no significant psychosocial factors that would predict poor response. If no such psychosocial factors are identified, conditional pre-authorization must be obtained from the payor for a trial of device effectiveness. Once conditional pre-authorization is received a trial of effectiveness must be conducted prior to implantation, employing a methodology that includes switching the spinal cord stimulator on and off, during which times the patient must keep a pain diary. If there is consistent reduction of pain when the stimulator is active (on), and recurrence of pain is consistently recorded during “off” periods, the device can be concluded to be effective, and implantation can be performed.<br>
