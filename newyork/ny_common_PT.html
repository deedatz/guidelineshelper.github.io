				New York Neck Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012<br> 
				<br>	
				D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE<br>
				Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br>
				Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
				Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
				Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. <br>
				Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone.<br>	
				The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order:<br><br>
				<b>D.10 THERAPY: ACTIVE</b><br>
				The following active therapies are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task.<br>This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual, and/or tactile instruction(s). At times, the provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient. Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Follow-up visits to reinforce and monitor progress and proper technique are recommended. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices.<br><br>
				<b>D.10.b Aquatic Therapy</b><br>
				Not recommended.<br><br>
				<b>D.10.d Functional Electrical Stimulation</b><br>
				Functional Electrical Stimulation is the application of electrical current to elicit involuntary or assisted contractions of atrophied and/or impaired muscles. Indications include muscle atrophy, weakness, and sluggish muscle contraction secondary to pain, injury, neuromuscular dysfunction or where the potential for atrophy exists. May be an appropriate treatment in conjunction with an active exercise program.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 8 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.10.e Neuromuscular Re-education</b><br>
				Neuromuscular Re-education is the skilled application of exercise with manual, mechanical, or electrical facilitation to enhance strength, movement patterns, neuromuscular response,
				proprioception, kinesthetic sense, and coordination, education of movement, balance, and posture. Indications include the need to promote neuromuscular responses through carefully timed proprioceptive stimuli, to elicit and improve motor activity in patterns similar to normal neurologically developed sequences, and improve neuromotor response with independent control.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.10.f Spinal Stabilization</b><br>
				The goal of this therapeutic program is to strengthen the spine in its neural and anatomic position. The stabilization is dynamic which allows whole body movements while maintaining a stabilized spine. It is the ability to move and function normally through postures and activities without creating undue vertebral stress.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 4 to 8 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.10.g Therapeutic Exercise</b><br>
				Therapeutic Exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance, may include isoinertial, isotonic, isometric and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include the need for cardiovascular fitness, reduced edema, improved muscle strength, improved connective tissue strength and integrity, increased bone density, promotion of circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improvement of muscle recruitment, improved proprioception and coordination, increased range of motion and are used to promote normal movement patterns. Therapeutic exercise can also include complementary/ alternative exercise movement therapy (with oversight of a physician or appropriate healthcare professional).<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.11 THERAPY: PASSIVE</b><br>
				Therapy: Passive includes those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation and swelling. If employed, they should be used adjunctively with active therapies such as postural stabilization and exercise programs to help control swelling, pain, and inflammation during the active rehabilitation process. Passive therapies may be used intermittently as a therapist deems appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment.<br>
				On occasion, specific diagnoses and post-surgical conditions may warrant durations of treatment beyond those listed as "maximum.” Factors such as exacerbation of symptoms, re-injury, interrupted continuity of care and co-morbidities may also extend durations of care. Specific goals with objectively measured functional improvement during treatment must be cited to justify extended durations of care. It is recommended that, if no functional gain is observed after the number of treatments under “time to produce effect” has been completed, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or further consultations should be pursued.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.a Electrical Nerve Block</b><br>
				Electrical Nerve Block is not recommended.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.b Electrical Stimulation</b><br>
				Electrical Stimulation (unattended) (WCB) is not recommended.<br>
				For the purposes of these guidelines, unattended means that the physician or therapist is not physically present with the patient on a 1:1 basis when treatment is being administered.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.c Iontophoresis</b><br>
				Not recommended.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.d Manipulation</b><br>
				Manipulative treatment (not therapy) is defined as the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an operator to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by the injury or occupational disease, and has 	associated clinical significance.<br>
				Contraindications to manipulation may include joint instability, fractures, severe osteoporosis, infection, metastatic cancer, active inflammatory arthritides, and signs of progressive neurologic deficits, myelopathy, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or carotid artery disease. Relative contraindications include stenosis, spondylosis, and disc herniation.<br>
				D.11.d.i Manipulation is recommended for treatment of acute and sub-acute neck pain when tied to objective measures of improvement.<br>
				-Time to produce effect for all types of manipulative treatment: 1 to 6 treatments.
				-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week for the first 4 weeks as indicated by the severity of involvement and the desired effect, then up to 2 treatments per week for the next 4 weeks with re-evaluation for evidence of functional improvement or need for further workup. Continuance of treatment will depend upon functional improvement.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 8 to 12 weeks.<br>
				- Maximum Duration: 3 months. Extended durations of care beyond what is considered “maximum” may be necessary in cases of re-injury, interrupted continuity of care, exacerbation of symptoms, and in those patients with comorbidities.
				D.11.d.ii A maintenance program of spinal manipulation (by a physician (MD/DO), chiropractor or physical therapist) may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status. (See section D.12 Therapy: Ongoing Maintenance Care.)<br>
				D.11.d.iii There is no evidence that prophylactic treatment is effective, either for primary prevention (before the first episode of pain) or for secondary prevention (after recovery from an episode of neck pain) and prophylactic treatment is not recommended.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.g Massage (Manual or Mechanical)</b><br>
				Massage (Manual or Mechanical) consists of manipulation of soft tissue with broad-ranging relaxation and circulatory benefits.
				This may include stimulation of acupuncture points and acupuncture channels (acupressure), application of suction cups and techniques that include pressing, lifting, rubbing, pinching of soft tissues by or with the practitioner's hands. Indications include edema (peripheral or hard and non-pliable edema), muscle spasm, adhesions, the need to improve peripheral circulation and range of motion, or to increase muscle relaxation and flexibility prior to exercise.<br>
				As with all passive therapies, massage must be accompanied by exercise and patient education. Objective benefit (functional improvement along with symptom reduction) must be demonstrated in order for further treatment to continue.<br>
				D.11.g.i Massage is recommended for select use in subacute and chronic neck pain as an adjunct to more efficacious treatments consisting primarily of a graded aerobic and strengthening exercise program.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
				-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 2 months.<br>
				-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance, lack of benefit, or non-compliance with aerobic and strengthening exercises.<br>
				D.11.g.ii Massage is recommended as a treatment for acute neck pain and chronic radicular syndromes in which neck pain is a substantial symptom component<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
				-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 2 months.<br>
				-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance or lack of benefit.<br>
				D.11.g.iii Massage is recommended for patients with sub-acute and chronic neck pain without underlying serious pathology, such as fracture, tumor, or infection.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
				-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 2 months.<br>
				-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance or lack of benefit.<br>
				D.11.g.iv Mechanical devices for administering massage are not recommended.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.h Mobilization (Joint)</b><br>
				Mobilization consists of passive movement involving oscillatory motions to the vertebral segment(s). The passive mobility is performed in a graded manner (I, II, III, IV, or V), which depicts the speed and depth of joint motion during the maneuver. It may include skilled manual joint tissue stretching. Indications include the need to improve joint play, segmental alignment, improve intracapsular arthrokinematics, or reduce pain associated with tissue impingement. Mobilization should be accompanied by active therapy. For Level V mobilization, contraindications include joint instability, fractures, severe osteoporosis, infection, metastatic cancer, active inflammatory arthritides, and signs of progressive neurologic deficits, myelopathy, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or carotid artery disease. Relative contraindications include stenosis, spondylosis, and disc herniation.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 6 to 9 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 6 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.i Mobilization (Soft Tissue)</b><br>
				Mobilization of soft tissue is the skilled application of muscle energy, strain/counter strain, myofascial release, manual trigger point release, and other manual therapy techniques designed toimprove or normalize movement patterns through the reduction of soft tissue pain and restrictions. These can be interactive with the patient participating or can be with the patient relaxing and letting the practitioner move the body tissues. Indications include muscle spasm around a joint, trigger points, adhesions, and neural compression. Mobilization should be accompanied by active therapy.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 4 to 9 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 6 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.k Superficial Heat and Cold Therapy (Excluding Infrared Therapy)</b><br>
				Superficial heat and cold are thermal agents applied in various manners that lower or raise the body tissue temperature for the reduction of pain, inflammation, and/or effusion resulting from injury or induced by exercise. It includes application of heat just above the surface of the skin at acupuncture points. Indications include acute pain, edema and hemorrhage, need to increase pain threshold, reduce muscle spasm, and promote stretching/flexibility. May be used in conjunction with other active therapy and may be self-administered by the patient.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
				-Frequency: 2 to 5 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 3 weeks as primary or intermittently as an adjunct to other therapeutic procedures up to 2 months.
				-Maximum Duration: 2 months.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.l Traction</b><br>
				Manual traction is an integral part of manual manipulation or joint mobilization. Indications include decreased joint space, muscle spasm around joints, and the need for increased synovial nutrition and response. Manual traction is contraindicated in patients with tumor, infection, fracture, or fracture dislocation.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 1 to 3 sessions.<br>
				-Frequency: 2 to 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 30 days.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 1 month.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.m Traction: Mechanical</b><br>
				Mechanical traction is most commonly used for patients with<br>
				radicular findings. It is sometimes used to treat symptoms from decreased joint space and muscle spasm around the joints. If successful it should be shifted to home traction. Traction modalities are contraindicated in patients with tumor, infections, fracture, or fracture dislocation. Non-oscillating inversion traction methods are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma or hypertension. A home cervical traction unit may be purchased if therapy proves effective.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 1 to 3 sessions up to 30 minutes. If response is negative after 3 treatments, discontinue this modality.
				-Frequency: 2 to 3 times per week. A home cervical traction unit may be purchased if therapy proves effective.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 4 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.11.p Ultrasound (Including Phonophoresis)</b><br>
				Ultrasound (including Phonophoresis) uses sonic generators to deliver acoustic energy for therapeutic thermal and/or nonthermal soft tissue effects. Indications include scar tissue, adhesions, collagen fiber and muscle spasm, and the need to extend muscle tissue or accelerate the soft tissue healing.<br>
				Ultrasound with electrical stimulation is concurrent delivery of electrical energy that involves dispersive electrode placement.
				Indications include muscle spasm, scar tissue, pain modulation, and muscle facilitation.<br>
				Phonophoresis is the transfer of medication through the use of sonic generators to the target tissue to control inflammation and pain. These topical medications include, but are not limited to, steroidal anti-inflammatories and anesthetics.<br>
				-Time to Produce Effect: 6 to 15 treatments.<br>
				-Frequency: 3 times per week.<br>
				-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
				-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
				<b>D.12 THERAPY: ONGOING MAINTENANCE CARE</b><br>
				A maintenance program of PT, OT or spinal manipulation (by a physician (MD/DO), chiropractor or physical therapist) may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status.<br>
				Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record.<br>
				Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care.<br>
				Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions. <br>
				Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted. <br>
				The care of chronic neck symptoms should include an ongoing patient self -management program performed by the patient regularly and a self -directed pain management program initiated as indicated:<br>
				-An ongoing clinically appropriate self-management program, typically independent, home-based and self-directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function.<br>
				-In addition to the self -management program, a self directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases.<br>
				If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable.<br>
				Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the determination of MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted.<br><br>
				A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
				The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.
				Medical Care<br>
				A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
				Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
				A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
				Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
				A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br>
				Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
				A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
				If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
				Treatment Approaches<br>
				A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
				Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
				Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
				A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM<br>
				Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			<td>
			New York State Workers' Compensation Board<br>
			New York Mid and Low Back Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012 <br><br>
			D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES-NON-OPERATIVE <br>
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. <br>
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued. <br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
			Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. <br>
			Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. <br><br>
			D.9 THERAPY: ACTIVE <br>
			<b>D.9.a Therapeutic Exercise</b><br>
			Therapeutic Exercise (WCB) with or without mechanical assistance or resistance, may include isoinertial, isotonic, isometric and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include the need for cardiovascular fitness, reduced edema, improved muscle strength, improved connective tissue strength and integrity, increased bone density, promotion of circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improvement of muscle recruitment, improved proprioception and coordination, increased range of motion and are used to promote normal movement patterns. Therapeutic exercise can also include complementary/ alternative exercise movement therapy (with oversight of a physician or appropriate healthcare professional). <br>
			Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br>
			Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week. <br>
			Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks. <br>
			Maximum Duration: 8 weeks. <br><br>
			<b>D.9.b Aerobic Exercises</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.9.b.i Aerobic exercise is recommended for treatment of all patients with acute, subacute and chronic back pain, although most available evidence is from studies treating chronic back pain patients. Consideration should be given, however, to whether an evaluation is required prior to institution of vigorous exercises for those with significant cardiac disease, or significant potential for cardiovascular disease. For most patients, a structured, progressive walking program on level ground or no incline on a treadmill is recommended. There has been some controversy about whether bicycling is helpful or harmful from a biomechanical perspective (lordosis) and the back muscles are less active with bicycling, thus it may be less appropriate. Yet, if bicycling is the preferred exercise for the patient, it is believed to be far superior to performing no aerobic exercise. For those patients who desire other aerobic exercises, there are no specific data, although there are indications that imply that there is a direct correlation between benefit and the amount of aerobic activity that results in higher MET expenditure. Therefore, the activity that the patient will adhere to is believed to be the one most likely to be effective, given that compliance is a recognized problem.<br>
			-Frequency/Duration: For patients with chronic back pain, walking at least 4 times per week at 60% of predicted maximum heart rate (220-age = maximum heart rate) is recommended. One successful study benchmarked 20 minutes during Week 1, 30 minutes during Week 2, and 45 minutes after that point. For acute or subacute back pain patients, a graded walking program is generally desired, often using distance or time as minimum benchmarks. For example, a patient can start with 10 to 15 minutes twice a day for 1 week, and increase in 10 to 15 minute increments per week until at least 30 minutes per day is achieved.<br>
			-Discontinuation: Aerobic exercise should be discontinued when there is intolerance (rarely occurs) or development of other disorders. Nearly all patients should be encouraged to maintain aerobic exercises on a long-term basis for both prevention of back pain (see below), and to maintain optimal health.<br>
			D.9.b.ii For post-operative patients aerobic exercise is recommended.<br>
			In the absence of quality evidence to support this recommendation, it is suggested that the acute, subacute, chronic back pain guideline above for aerobic exercise be used for treatment of post-operative back pain patients<br><br>
			<b>D.9.c Strengthening and Stabilization Exercises</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.9.c.i For acute, subacute, or chronic back pain, or post-operative back pain patients, strengthening exercises are recommended for treatment of back pain. Specific strengthening exercises, such as stabilization exercises, are helpful for the prevention and treatment (including post-operative treatment) of back pain.<br>
			As evidence of efficacy of aerobic exercises appears greater, these exercises should be added after either aerobic exercises have already been instituted and additional treatment is needed, or in situations where both are felt to be required. Exercises should be taught and then performed by the patient in a home exercise program. For those patients who do not improve, follow up appointments to verify technique and compliance (by exercise log books) are recommended. Some patients, particularly those lacking motivation to be in a home exercise program may benefit from a supervised exercise program, although there are questions about long-term compliance among patients with chronic back pain. More intensive programs with more intensive exercises and direct supervision with active coaching have been shown to be effective for chronic back pain.<br>
			-Frequency/Duration: Home program frequency is 1 to 2 times a day for acute back pain, and two to three times a day for subacute or chronic back pain.
			<br>
			-Discontinuation: Indications to discontinue strengthening exercises include development of a strain in the course of treatment or failure to improve.
			<br>
			D.9.c.ii Abdominal strengthening exercises particularly as either a sole or central goal of a strengthening program are not recommended for treatment or prevention of back pain.<br>
			Strengthening of abdominal muscles (e.g., rectus abdominus and obliques with sit-up exercises) is a frequent goal of back pain rehabilitation or prevention programs. There is no quality evidence that these exercises are effective, there is evidence that suggests they are not effective, and there are other treatment strategies with proven or at least suggested greater efficacy.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.d Aquatic Therapy (Including Swimming)</b></a><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.9.d.i A trial of aquatic therapy is recommended for the treatment of subacute or chronic back pain in a patient who meets criteria for a referral for supervised exercise therapy and has co-morbidities (e.g., extreme obesity, significant degenerative joint disease, etc.) that preclude effective participation in a weight-bearing physical activity. Osteoarthritis of the knee is not a clear contraindication to a walking program, rather walking may be therapeutically indicated based on high quality evidence.<br>
			-Frequency/Duration: A program should generally begin with 3 to 4 visits per week. The patient must have demonstrated evidence of functional improvement within the first 2 weeks to justify additional visits. The program should include up to 4 weeks of aquatic therapy with progression towards a land-based, self-directed physical activity or self-directed aquatic therapy program by 6 weeks.<br>
			-Discontinuation: Non-tolerance, failure to progress, or reaching a 4 to 6 week time frame.<br>
			For all other subacute and chronic back pain patients, and for all acute back pain, aquatic therapy is not recommended as other therapies are believed to be more efficacious.<br><br>
			D.10 THERAPY: PASSIVE<br>
			<b>D.10.a Manipulation</b><br>
			Manipulative treatment (not therapy) (WCB) is defined as the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an operator to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by the injury or occupational disease, and has associated clinical significance.<br>
			Contraindications to manipulation may include joint instability, fractures, severe osteoporosis, infection, metastatic cancer, active inflammatory arthritides, and signs of progressive neurologic deficits, or myelopathy. Relative contraindications include stenosis, spondylosis, and disc herniation.<br>
			D.10.a.i Manipulation is recommended for treatment of acute and sub-acute back pain when tied to objective measures of improvement.<br>
			-Time to produce effect for all types of manipulative treatment: 1 to 6 treatments.<br>
			-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week for the first 4 weeks as indicated by the severity of involvement and the desired effect, then up to 2 treatments per week for the next 4 weeks with re-evaluation for evidence of functional improvement or need for further workup. Continuance of treatment will depend upon functional improvement.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 8 to 12 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 3 months. Extended durations of care beyond what is considered “maximum” may be necessary in cases of re-injury, interrupted continuity of care, exacerbation of symptoms, and in those patients with comorbidities.<br>
			D.10.a.ii A maintenance program of spinal manipulation (by a physician (MD/DO), chiropractor or physical therapist) may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status. (See section D.11 Therapy: Ongoing Maintenance.)<br>
			D.10.a.iii There is no evidence that prophylactic treatment is effective, either for primary prevention (before the first episode of pain) or for secondary prevention (after recovery from an episode of back pain) and prophylactic treatment is not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.b Manipulation under Anesthesia (MUA) and Medication-Assisted Spinal Manipulation (MASM)</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			-MUA and MASM are not recommended in acute, subacute or chronic back pain patients.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.c Massage (Manual or Mechanical)</b><br>
			Massage (Manual or Mechanical) (WCB) consists of manipulation of soft tissue with broad-ranging relaxation and circulatory benefits. This may include stimulation of acupuncture points and acupuncture channels (acupressure), application of suction cups and techniques that include pressing, lifting, rubbing, pinching of soft tissues by or with the practitioner's hands. Indications include edema (peripheral or hard and non-pliable edema), muscle spasm, adhesions, the need to improve peripheral circulation and range of motion, or to increase muscle relaxation and flexibility prior to exercise.
			As with all passive therapies, massage must be accompanied by exercise and patient education. Objective benefit (functional improvement along with symptom reduction) must be demonstrated in order for further treatment to continue.<br>
			D.10.c.i Massage is recommended for select use in subacute and chronic back pain as an adjunct to more efficacious treatments consisting primarily of a graded aerobic and strengthening exercise program.
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
			-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance, lack of benefit, or non-compliance with aerobic and strengthening exercises.<br>
			D.10.c.ii Massage is recommended as a treatment for acute back pain and chronic radicular syndromes in which back pain is a substantial symptom component.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
			-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance or lack of benefit.<br>
			D.10.c.iii Massage is recommended for patients with sub-acute and chronic back pain without underlying serious pathology, such as fracture, tumor, or infection.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
			-Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance or lack of benefit.<br>
			D.10.c.iv Mechanical devices for administering massage are not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.d Mobilization (Joint)</b><br>
			Mobilization (WCB) consists of passive movement involving oscillatory motions to the vertebral segment(s). The passive mobility is performed in a graded manner (I, II, III, IV, or V), which depicts the speed and depth of joint motion during the maneuver. It may include skilled manual joint tissue stretching. Indications include the need to improve joint play, segmental alignment, improve intracapsular arthrokinematics, or reduce pain associated with tissue impingement. Mobilization should be accompanied by active therapy. For Level V mobilization, contraindications include joint instability, fractures, severe osteoporosis, infection, metastatic cancer, active inflammatory arthritides, and signs of progressive neurologic deficits, myelopathy, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or carotid artery disease. Relative contraindications include stenosis, spondylosis, and disc herniation.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 6 to 9 treatments.<br>
			-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 6 weeks.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.e Mobilization (Soft Tissue)</b><br>
			Mobilization of soft tissue (WCB) is the skilled application of muscle energy, strain/counter strain, myofascial release, manual trigger point release, and other manual therapy techniques designed to improve or normalize movement patterns through the reduction of soft tissue pain and restrictions. These can be interactive with the patient participating or can be with the patient relaxing and letting the practitioner move the body tissues. Indications include muscle spasm around a joint, trigger points, adhesions, and neural compression. Mobilization should be accompanied by active therapy.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 4 to 9 treatments.<br>
			-Frequency: Up to 3 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 6 weeks.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.f Superficial Heat and Cold</b><br>
			Superficial heat and cold (WCB) are thermal agents applied in various manners that lower or raise the body temperature for the reduction of pain, inflammation, and/or effusion resulting from injury or induced by exercise. It includes application of heat just above the surface of the skin at acupuncture points.<br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.10.f.i Recommended for acute pain, edema, and hemorrhage, need to increase the pain threshold, reduce muscle spasm, and promote <span></span>tretching/flexibility. Cold and heat packs can be used at home as an extension of therapy in the clinic setting.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency/Duration: Frequency: 2 to 5 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 3 weeks as primary, or intermittently as an adjunct to other therapeutic procedures up to two months.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.i Ultrasound</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.10.i.i In situations where deeper heating is desirable, a limited trial of ultrasound for the treatment of back pain is reasonable, but only if performed as an adjunct with exercise.<br>
			-Frequency/Duration: 3 times per week.<br>
			-Time to produce effect: 6 to 15 treatments.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
			<b>D.10.k Myofascial Release</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.10.k.i Myofascial release is not recommended for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndromes or other back-related conditions.<br><br>
			<b>D.11 THERAPY: ONGOING MAINTENANCE CARE</b><br>
			A maintenance program of PT, OT or spinal manipulation (by a physician (MD/DO), chiropractor or physical therapist) may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status.<br>
			-Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record.<br>
			-Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care.<br>
			-Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions.<br>
			-Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted.<br>
			-The care of chronic back symptoms should include an ongoing patient self -management program performed by the patient regularly and a self-directed pain management program initiated as indicated:
			-An ongoing clinically appropriate self-management program, typically independent, home-based and self-directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function.<br>
			-In addition to the self-management program, a self-directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases.
			-If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable.<br>
			Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the determination of MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status . No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted.<br><br>
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES <br>
			The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines. <br>
			Medical Care <br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE <br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible. <br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES <br>
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses. <br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE <br>
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation. <br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
			Treatment Approaches <br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS <br>
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. 
			Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br> 
			A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM <br>
			Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. <br><br>

			<b>D.3 BICIPITAL TENDON DISORDERS</b><br>
			D.3.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders)<br>
			D.3.e.iii Physical medicine and rehabilitation interventions should emphasize a progressive increase in range of motion. With increasing motion and pain control, a strengthening program should be instituted and return to modified/limited duty would be considered at this time. By 8-11 weeks, with restoration of full motion, return to full duty should be anticipated.<br><br>
			<b>D.4 BRACHIOPLEXUS INJURIES</b><br>

			D.4.f.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Suprascapular Nerve)<br>
			(a) Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.5 BURSITIS OF THE SHOULDER</b><br>
			D.5.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Bursitis of the Shoulder)<br>
			D.5.e.i Benefits may be achieved through non-operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation and work station, thermal therapy, and ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate.<br>
			D.5.e.ii May return to work without overhead activities and lifting with involved arm until cleared by physician for those and heavier activities.<br>
			D.5.e.iii Additional modalities/treatment procedures may include physical medicine and rehabilitation including instruction in therapeutic exercise, proper work technique and manual therapy; vocational rehabilitation, vocational assessment and interdisciplinary team approach. Biofeedback is not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>D.6 IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME</b><br>
			D.6.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Impingement Syndrome)<br>
			Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include:<br>
			D.6.e.iv Non-Operative Treatment Procedures, such as relative rest, immobilization, thermal treatment, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise and physical medicine and rehabilitation should be considered.<br><br>
			<b>D.7 ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</b><br>
			D.7.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tear)<br>
			D.7.e.ii Relative rest and non-operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation/work station, thermal treatment, and therapeutic ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate. If no clinically significant increase in function for a partial- or full-thickness tear is observed after adequate participation in a rehabilitation program, a surgical consultation is indicated. Adequate is here defined as at least 75% attendance in an active physical therapy program with a minimum of 2-3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. A physical therapy program that is based solely on passive modalities, or for which the claimant has not demonstrated compliance is insufficient. Early surgical intervention produces better surgical outcome due to healthier tissues and often less limitation of movement prior to and after surgery.<br><br>
			<b>D.8 ROTATOR CUFF TENDINITIS</b><br>
			D.8.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tendinitis)<br>
			Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include:<br>
			D.8.e.iii Non-operative treatment procedures/modalities such as relative rest, immobilization, thermal treatment, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise, physical medicine and rehabilitation should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate.<br><br>
			<b>D.9 SHOULDER FRACTURES</b><br>
			There are five common types of shoulder fractures. Each type will be addressed separately and in the order of most frequent occurrence.<br>
			<b>D.9.a Clavicular Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.a.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Clavicular Fracture)<br>
			(a) Most are adequately managed by closed techniques and do not require surgery. After reduction, the arm is immobilized in a sling or figure-8 bandage.<br>
			Shoulder rehabilitation is begun with pendulum exercises 10-14 days after injury. Subsequently, with pain control, the therapy program can be progressed with non-operative therapeutic approaches.<br><br> 
			<b>D.9.b Proximal Humeral Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.b.v Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative (Proximal Humeral Fracture)<br>
			(g) Shoulder rehabilitation is begun with pendulum exercises 10-14 days after injury. Subsequently, with pain control, the therapy program can be progressed with therapeutic approaches noted in Section E, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.c Humeral Shaft Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.c.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Humeral Shaft Fracture)<br>	
			(a) Most isolated humeral shaft fractures can be managed non-operatively.<br>
			(d) At 2-3 weeks after injury, a humeral fracture orthosis may be used to allow for full elbow motion.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.d Scapular Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.d.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Scapular Fracture)<br>
			(a) Non-displaced acromial, coracoid, glenoid, glenoid neck and scapular body fractures may all be treated with the use of a shoulder immobilizer.

			D.10.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Shoulder Instability)<br>
			Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation<br>
			D.10.e.ii Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques<br><br>
			<b>D.11 SUPERIOR LABRUM ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR (SLAP) LESIONS</b><br>
			D.11.d Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (SLAP Lesion)<br>
			Most SLAP lesions are associated with other pathology such as rotator cuff tears, Bankart lesions, joint instability, biceps tendon tears, and supraspinatus tears. The provider should refer to the treatment protocols for these conditions and follow both the surgical and non-surgical recommendations. For suspected isolated SLAP lesions, non-invasive care, consider the following.<br>
			D.11.d.iii Benefits may be achieved through therapeutic rehabilitation and rehabilitation interventions. They should include range-of-motion (ROM), active therapies, and a home exercise program. Passive as well as active therapies may be used for control of pain and swelling. Therapy should progress to strengthening and an independent home exercise program targeted to further improve ROM and strength of the shoulder girdle musculature.<br><br>
			E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE<br><br>
			<b>E.4 THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE</b><br>
			Therapeutic Exercise where the therapist instructs the patient in a supervised clinic and home program to increase strength of the supporting shoulder musculature. Motions and muscles to be strengthened include shoulder internal and external rotators, abductors and scapula stabilizers. Isometrics are performed initially, progressing to Isotonic exercises as tolerated.<br>
			Frequency of visits: 2-3 times/week for 8-12 weeks.<br>
			Weeks 1-3: Isometrics in sling.<br>
			Weeks 3-8: Progressive Isotonic exercises.<br>
			Weeks 8-12: Begin overhead activities when the rotator cuff strength is normalized and full active elevation has been achieved.<br><br>
			<b>E.11 PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION</b><br>
			E.11.a Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques<br>
			An active therapeutic exercise program may be beneficial and should contain elements of improving patient flexibility, mobility, posture/body mechanics, activities of daily living, splinting, bracing, sensory reeducation, endurance, strength and education.<br>
			Time to produce effect: 2 weeks.<br>
			Frequency: 2-3 times/week.<br>
			Optimum duration: 4-6 weeks, or longer for cases of adhesive capsulitis. Refer to D.2.e, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder).<br>
			Maximum duration: 12 weeks.<br>
			E.11.b Manual Therapy Techniques<br>
			Soft tissue mobilization/ manipulation techniques may be used as an adjunctive treatment modality.<br>
			E.11.c Post-Operative Treatment<br>
			Post-Operative Treatment may include scar/adhesion reduction techniques.<br><br>
			<b>E.12 THERAPY: ONGOING MAINTENANCE CARE</b><br>
			A maintenance program of PT or OT may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status.<br>
			Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record.<br>
			Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care.<br>
			Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions.<br>
			Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted.<br>
			The care of chronic shoulder symptoms should include an ongoing patient self -management program performed by the patient regularly and a selfdirected pain management program initiated as indicated:<br>
 			-An ongoing clinically appropriate self-management program, typically independent, home-based and self-directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function.<br>
			-In addition to the self -management program, a self-directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases.<br>
			-If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable. Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the determination of MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted.<br><br>

			New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012<br><br> 
			D SPECIFIC KNEE INJURY DIAGNOSES, TESTING, AND TREATMENT<br><br> 
			<b>D.1 CHONDRAL DEFECTS (Cartilage or Cartilage and Bone Defects)</b><br>
			D.1.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Limited indications. The size and extent of the injury should be determined first. This form of therapy is reserved for non-displaced, stable lesions. Immobilization (for acute injury), active and/or passive therapy. <br><br>
			<B>D.2 AGGRAVATED OSTEOARTHRITIS</B><br>
			D.2.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			NSAIDS , ice, bracing, active and/or passive therapy, therapeutic injections, which may include hyaluronate therapy, restricted activity. <br><br>
			<b>D.3 COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY</b><br>
			D.3.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Isolated Grade I collateral ligament tears and many Grade II tears have been shown to heal with excellent results without surgical intervention. When accompanying cruciate or meniscus injuries are ruled out, the patient can be treated non-operatively. Conservative management with casting, orthotics and rehabilitation may be indicated. <br><br>
			<b>D.4 ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT (ACL) INJURY</b><br>
			D.4.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing. <br><br>
			<b>D.5 POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT (PCL) INJURY</b><br>
			D.5.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing. <br><br>
			<b>D.6 MENISCUS INJURY</b><br>
			D.7.c Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing. Trial of Manipulation may be attempted for a locked knee. Clinical response should be seen within 2-3 treatments. <br><br>
			<b>D.9 PATELLAR SUBLUXATION</b><br>
			D.9.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing, therapeutic injection. <br><br>
			<b>D.10 RETROPATELLAR PAIN SYNDROME (CHONDROMALACIA PATELLA)</b><br>
			D.10.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing, orthotics, therapeutic injections. <br><br>
			<b>D.11 TENDINITIS/TENOSYNOVITIS</b><br> 
			D.11.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, including ergonomic changes at work station(s), NSAIDs, therapeutic injections. <br><br>
			<b>D.12 BURSITIS</b><br>
			D.12.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, ice, therapeutic injection, treatment of an underlying infection, if present. <br><br>
			E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, NON-OPERATIVE<br> 
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.<br> 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br> 
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms.<br>
			In unusual cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. <br><br>
			E.7 THERAPY-ACTIVE <br>
			Most of the following active therapies have some evidence and are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). At times, the provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient.<br>
			Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. <br><br>
			<b>E.7.d Neuromuscular Re-education</b><br>
			Not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>E.7.e Therapeutic Exercise</b><br>
			Therapeutic Exercise, with or without mechanical assistance or resistance, may include isoinertial, isotonic, isometric and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include the need for cardiovascular fitness, reduced edema, improved muscle strength, improved connective tissue strength and integrity, increased bone density, promotion of circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improvement of muscle recruitment, increased range of motion and are used to promote normal movement patterns. Can also include complementary/ alternative exercise movement therapy. <br>
			Time to produce effect: 2 to 6 treatments. <br>
			Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week. <br>
			Optimum duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br> 
			Maximum duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
			E.8 THERAPY-PASSIVE<br>
			Therapy-Passive includes those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation and swelling. They should be use adjunctively with active therapies to help control swelling, pain and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. They may be used intermittently as deemed appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment.<br>
			While protocols for specific diagnoses and post-surgical conditions may warrant durations of treatment beyond those listed as "maximum,” factors such as exacerbation of symptoms, re-injury, interrupted continuity of care, and co-morbidities may extend durations of care. Having specific goals with objectively measured functional improvement during treatment can support extended durations of care. It is recommended that if after 3 to 5 visits no treatment effect is observed, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or further consultations should be pursued.<br>
			The following passive therapies and modalities are listed in alphabetical order with the exception of kinesiotaping, taping or strapping, which has been placed last to preserve the original numbering of the other therapies.<br><br>
			<b>E.8.a Continuous Passive Movement (CPM)</b><br>
			Continuous Passive Movement) is a form of passive motion using specialized machinery that acts to move a joint and may also pump blood and edema fluid away from the joint and periarticular tissues. CPM is effective in preventing the development of joint stiffness if applied immediately following surgery. It should be continued until the swelling that limits motion of the joint no longer develops. Range of motion for the joint begins at the level of patient tolerance and is increased twice a day as tolerated. Use of this equipment may require home visits.<br>

			<b>E.8.i Massage, Manual or Mechanical</b><br>
			Not recommended. <br><br>
			<b>E.8.j Mobilization (Joint)</b><br>
			Mobilization is passive movement, which may include passive range of motion performed in such a manner (particularly in relation to the speed of the movement) that it is, at all times, within the ability of the patient to prevent the movement if they so choose. It may include skilled manual joint tissue stretching. Indications include the need to improve joint play, improve intracapsular arthrokinematics, or reduce pain associated with tissue impingement/maltraction.<br>

			<br>
			<b>E.9 THERAPY: ONGOING MAINTENANCE CARE</b><br>
			A maintenance program of PT or OT may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status.<br>
			Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record.<br>
			Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care.<br>
			Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions.<br> 
			Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted.<br> 
			The care of chronic knee symptoms should include an ongoing patient self -management program performed by the patient regularly and a self -directed pain management program initiated as indicated:<br> 
			-An ongoing clinically appropriate self-management program, typically independent, home-based and self-directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function.<br> 
			-In addition to the self-management program, a self-directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases.<br> 
			If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement restitution of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable.<br> 
			Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the determination MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted.<br><br>
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
			A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAMS<br>
			Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			New York Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Medical Treatment Guidelines First Edition, October 1, 2012<br><br>
			E NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT PROCEDURES<br>
			E.4.e. Therapy: Active<br>
			The following active therapies are widely used and accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. They are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and alleviating discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task, and thus assists in developing skills promoting independence to allow self-care after discharge. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual, and/or tactile instructions. At times a provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient.<br>
			Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Follow-up visits to reinforce and monitor progress and proper technique are recommended. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. The following active therapies and modalities are listed in alphabetical order.<br><br>
			<b>E.4.e.v Therapeutic Exercise</b> with or without medical assistance or resistance may include isointertial, isotonic, isometric, and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include: reduce edema, improve muscle strength, improve connective tissue strength and integrity, increase bone density, promote circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improve muscle recruitment, increase range of motion, and promote normal movement patterns. Can also include complementary/alternative exercise such as movement therapy (with oversight of a physician or other appropriate healthcare professional).<br> 
			-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br> 
			-Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week.<br> 
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br> 
			-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>
			<b>E.4.e.iii Nerve Gliding </b>exercises consist of range of motion (ROM) exercises of the upper extremity and neck that produce tension and longitudinal movement along the length of the median and other nerves of the upper extremity.<br>
			These exercises are based on the principle that the tissues of the peripheral nervous system are designed for movement, and that tension and glide (excursion) of nerves may have an effect on neurophysiology through alterations in vascular and axoplasmic flow. The exercises are simple to perform and can be done by the patient after brief instruction. Biomechanical principles have been more thoroughly studied than clinical outcomes. Large, well-designed randomized trials have been lacking. There is some evidence from a systematic review that nerve gliding is more effective than no treatment.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 4 weeks.<br> 
			-Frequency: Up to 5 times per day by patient (patient-initiated).<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 2 provider-directed sessions.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 3 provider-directed sessions.<br>
			<b>E.4.e.iv Neuromuscular Re-education</b> is the skilled application of exercise with manual, mechanical, or electrical facilitation to enhance strength, movement patterns, neuromuscular response, proprioception, kinesthetic sense, coordination education of movement, balance, and posture. Indications include the need to promote neuromuscular responses through carefully timed proprioceptive stimuli, to elicit and improve motor activity in patterns similar to normal neurologically developed sequences, and improve neuromotor response with independent control. 
			-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 6 treatments.<br>
			-Frequency: 3 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.
			-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br> 

			<b>E.4.e.v Therapeutic Exercise</b> with or without medical assistance or resistance may include isointertial, isotonic, isometric, and isokinetic types of exercises.

			-Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>

			E.4.f. Therapy: Passive<br> 
			Most of the following passive therapies and modalities are generally well-accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. These include treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and swelling to improve the rate of healing soft tissue injuries. They should be used in adjunct with active therapies to help control swelling, pain, and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. They may be used intermittently as a therapist deems appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment.<br><br>

			<b>E.4.f.ii Electrical Stimulation (Unattended):</b> Once applied, requires minimal on-site supervision by the physician or non-physician provider. Indications include pain, inflammation, muscle spasm, atrophy, and decreased circulation. Electrical stimulation is rarely used in cumulative trauma conditions. It may be appropriate in rare situations when nerve damage or other work-related issues have resulted in muscle atrophy and the patient is unable to engage in sufficient active therapy to increase muscle mass.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 2 to 4 treatments.<br>
			-Frequency: Varies, depending upon indication, between 2 to 3 times/day to 1 time/week. Provide home unit if frequent use.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 2 to 4 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: Home unit as needed.<br><br>

			<b>E.4.f.iii Iontophoresis, Magnets or Laser Acupuncture: </b>There is no evidence for the use of iontophoresis, magnets or laser acupuncture. Therefore these interventions are not recommended.<br><br>

			<b>E.4.f.iv Low Level Laser:</b> There is no evidence that low level laser therapy alone is beneficial in changing the outcome for patients with CTS and therefore it is not recommended.<br><br>

			<b>E.4.f.v Manual Therapy Techniques:</b> There is no evidence supporting manipulation of the spine for treatment of CTS. There is no clear evidence supporting carpal bone mobilization or manual therapy. However, other myofascial components that may occur with CTS may be treated with manual therapy. <br><br>
			
			<b>E.4.f.vi Massage Manual or Mechanical:</b> Massage is manipulation of soft tissue with broad ranging relaxation and circulatory benefits. This may include stimulation of acupuncture points and acupuncture channels (acupressure), and techniques that include pressing, lifting, rubbing, pinching of soft tissues by or with the practitioners' hands. Indications include edema, muscle spasm, adhesions, the need to improve peripheral circulation and range of motion, or to increase muscle relaxation and flexibility prior to exercise.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br> 
			-Maximum Duration: 2 months.<br><br> 
			
			<b>E.4.f.viii Superficial Heat and Cold Therapy:</b> Thermal agents are applied in various manners that lower or raise the body tissue temperature for the reduction of pain, inflammation, and/or effusion resulting from injury or induced by exercise. Includes application of heat just above the surface of the skin at acupuncture points. Indications include acute pain, edema, need to increase pain threshold, reduce muscle spasm and promote stretching/flexibility. Cold and heat packs can be used at home as an extension of therapy in the clinic setting.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 2 to 5 times per week (clinic). Home treatment as needed.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 3 weeks as primary or intermittently as an adjunct to other therapeutic procedures up to 2 months.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 2 months. If symptoms persist, consideration should be given to further diagnostic studies or other treatment options.<br><br>
			<b>E.4.f.ix Ultrasound:</b> There is some evidence that ultrasound may be effective in symptom relief and in improving nerve conduction in mild-to-moderate cases of CTS. No studies have demonstrated long-term functional benefit. This treatment may be used in conjunction with an active therapy program for non-surgical patients who do not improve with splinting and activity modification. It is not known if there are any long-term deleterious neurological effects from ultrasound.<br> 
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.<br>
			-Optimum Duration: 6 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration:<br>
			-Ultrasound treatments may extend longer if objective functional gains can be documented or when benefits facilitate progression in the patient's treatment program.<br>
			Treatment beyond 12 sessions must be documented with respect to the need and ability to facilitate positive functional gains.<br><br> 

			<b>E.4.g. Ongoing Maintenance Care</b><br> 
			A maintenance program of PT or OT may be indicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status.<br> 
			-Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record.<br> 
			-Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care.
			-Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions.<br>
			-Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted.<br>
			-The care of chronic CTS symptoms should include an ongoing patient self-management program performed by the patient regularly and a self-directed pain management program initiated as indicated: o An ongoing clinically appropriate self-management program, typically independent, home-based, and self-directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function.<br>
			-In addition to the self-management program, a self-directed pain management plan should be developed, which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases.<br> 
			-If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable.<br>
			Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the determination of MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted.<br><br>

			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br> 
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br> 
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains that can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures that can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br> 
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br> 
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter.

				<b>E.1.a Halo Immobilization</b><br>
				E.1.a.v Post-Operative Therapy: Traction may be required for re-alignment and or fracture reduction (amount to be determined by surgeon), active and/or passive therapy, pin care.<br><br>
				<b>E.1.b Anterior or Posterior Decompression with Fusion</b><br>
				E.1.b.v Post-Operative Treatment: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6-12 weeks with fusion). Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program, with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening, and restoration of range of motion, is appropriate once the fusion is solid and without complication. New techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. Active treatment, which patients should have had prior to surgery, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
				<b>E.2 DISC HERNIATION AND OTHER CERVICAL CONDITIONS</b><br>
				<b>E.2.b.i Cervical Discectomy with or without Fusion:</b><br>
				Post-Operative Therapy: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6 - 12 weeks with fusion). Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program, with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening and restoration of ROM is appropriate, once fusion is solid and without complication. New techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. Active treatment, which patients should have had prior to surgery, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>	
				<b>E.2.b.ii Cervical Corpectomy</b><br>
				Post-Operative Therapy: Dependent upon number of vertebral bodies involved, healing time may be longer than discectomy. Halo vest care has traditionally been required, but new techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid mobilization. Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening is appropriate for most patients once the cervical spine is deemed stable and without complication.Newer surgical techniques may permit earlier referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
				<b>E.2.b.iii Cervical Laminectomy with or without Foraminotomy or Fusion</b><br>
				Post-Operative Therapy: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6 to 12 weeks with fusion), although newer surgical techniques may not require prolonged immobilization. Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening and restoration of range of motion is appropriate for most patients once the cervical spine is deemed stable and without complication.

Active elbow and wrist motion may be started immediately.<br>
			<B>D.9.d Scapular Fracture</B><br>
			D.9.d.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Scapular Fracture)<br>
			Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist.

			<b>D.10 SHOULDER INSTABILITY</b><br>
			D.10.g Post-Operative Procedures (Shoulder Instability)<br>
			Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Depending upon the type of surgery, the patient will be immobilized for 3-6 weeks. As soon as it is safe to proceed without damaging the repair, progressive therapy with consultation involving an occupational and/or physical therapist should begin with therapeutic exercise, physical medicine and rehabilitation. During this period of time, the patient could resume working when:<br>
			D.10.g.i Medications which would predispose to injury are no longer being prescribed or used; and<br>
			D.10.g.ii The treating physician has cleared the patient for the specific vocational activities.<br>

			<b>D.11 SUPERIOR LABRUM ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR (SLAP) LESIONS</b>
			D.11.g Post-Operative Treatment (SLAP lesion)<br>
			Post-operative rehabilitation programs should be individualized and dependent upon whether any other intra-articular abnormalities exist and were operatively treated. There is a paucity of information on rehabilitation of isolated SLAP lesions. Common post-operative care involves wearing a sling, without active shoulder motion for 4 to 6 weeks. Elbow, wrist, and hand range-of-motion (ROM) exercises may be used at this time. The sling is removed at 4 to 6 weeks and active ROM is usually begun with restrictions directed by the surgeon. It is reasonable to restrict external rotation and abduction up to six months post-operative.<br><br>

			<b>E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE</b><br>
			E.4 THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE<br>
			Therapeutic Exercise where the therapist instructs the patient in a supervised clinic and home program to increase strength of the supporting shoulder musculature. Motions and muscles to be strengthened include shoulder internal and external rotators, abductors and scapula stabilizers. Isometrics are performed initially, progressing to Isotonic exercises as tolerated.<br>
			Frequency of visits: 2-3 times/week for 8-12 weeks.<br>
			Weeks 1-3: Isometrics in sling.<br>
			Weeks 3-8: Progressive Isotonic exercises.<br>
			Weeks 8-12: Begin overhead activities when the rotator cuff strength is normalized and full active elevation has been achieved.<br><br>

			E.11 PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION<br>
			E.11.a Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques<br>
			An active therapeutic exercise program may be beneficial and should contain elements of improving patient flexibility, mobility, posture/body mechanics, activities of daily living, splinting, bracing, sensory reeducation, endurance, strength and education.<br>
			Time to produce effect: 2 weeks.<br>
			Frequency: 2-3 times/week.<br>
			Optimum duration: 4-6 weeks, or longer for cases of adhesive capsulitis. Refer to D.2.e, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder).<br>
			Maximum duration: 12 weeks.<br>
			E.11.b Manual Therapy Techniques<br>
			Soft tissue mobilization/ manipulation techniques may be used as an adjunctive treatment modality.<br>
			E.11.c Post-Operative Treatment<br>
			Post-Operative Treatment may include scar/adhesion reduction techniques.<br><br>
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE <br>
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br>
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
			A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM<br>
			Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, NON-OPERATIVE<br> 
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.<br> 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br> 
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms.<br>
			In unusual cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. <br><br>
			E.7 THERAPY-ACTIVE <br>
			Most of the following active therapies have some evidence and are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). At times, the provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient.<br>
			Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. <br><br>
			<b>E.7.d Neuromuscular Re-education</b><br>
			Not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>E.7.e Therapeutic Exercise</b><br>
			Therapeutic Exercise, with or without mechanical assistance or resistance, may include isoinertial, isotonic, isometric and isokinetic types of exercises. Indications include the need for cardiovascular fitness, reduced edema, improved muscle strength, improved connective tissue strength and integrity, increased bone density, promotion of circulation to enhance soft tissue healing, improvement of muscle recruitment, increased range of motion and are used to promote normal movement patterns. Can also include complementary/ alternative exercise movement therapy. <br>
			Time to produce effect: 2 to 6 treatments. <br>
			Frequency: 3 to 5 times per week. <br>
			Optimum duration: 4 to 8 weeks.<br> 
			Maximum duration: 8 weeks.<br><br>

			F.3 POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT<br>
			F.3.a. Home Therapy<br>
			Patients may receive a home therapy protocol involving stretching, ROM, scar management and resistive exercises. Patients should be encouraged to use the hand as much as possible for daily activities, but warned not to overuse their hands in the performance of daily activities. Patients should be encouraged to allow the presence of pain to guide their activities.<br><br>
			F.3.b. Mobilization<br>
			There is some evidence showing that immediate mobilization of the wrist following surgery is associated with less scar pain, and faster return to work. Final decisions regarding the need for postoperative splinting should be left to the discretion of the treating physician based upon the surgical technique used and the specific conditions of the patient.<br><br>
			F.3.c. Rehabilitation<br>
			An individualized rehabilitation program may be helpful in patients who do not show functional postoperative improvements or in patients with heavy or repetitive job activities. Two postoperative visits are recommended to ensure appropriate scar management and two additional visits, at intervals of four to six weeks afterwards, are recommended to ensure appropriate return to function.<br>
			The postoperative rehabilitation program should be based upon communication between the treating physician and the therapist. In all cases, communication between the physician and therapist is important to the timing of exercise progression.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
			-Frequency: 2 to 3 times a week.<br>
			-Optimum duration: 6 weeks.<br>
			-Maximum duration: 12 weeks.<br>
			Communication is essential between the patient, employer and physician to determine appropriate restrictions and return-to-work dates. It is the responsibility of the physician to provide clear and concise restrictions, and it is the employer's responsibility to determine if temporary duties can be provided within the restrictions.<br><br>
