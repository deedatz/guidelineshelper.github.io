				New York Neck Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012<br><br>
				D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE<br>
				Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br>
				Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
				Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
				Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. <br>
				Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone.<br>	
				The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order:<br><br>

				D.3 INJECTIONS: THERAPEUTIC<br>
				D.3.a Therapeutic Spinal Injections<br>
				Description:<br>
				Therapeutic spinal injections may be used after initial conservative treatments, such as physical and occupational therapy, medication, manual therapy, exercise, acupuncture, have been undertaken. Therapeutic injections should be used only after imaging studies and diagnostic injections have established pathology. Injections are invasive procedures that can cause catastrophic complications; thus clinical indications and contraindications should be closely adhered to. The purpose of spinal injections is to facilitate active therapy by providing short term relief through reduction of pain and inflammation. All patients should continue appropriate exercise with functionally directed rehabilitation. Active treatment, which patients should have had prior to injections, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. Injections, by themselves, are not likely to provide long-term relief. Rather, active rehabilitation with modified work achieves long-term relief by increasing active range of motion, strength, and stability. If the first injection does not provide a diagnostic response with temporary and sustained pain relief substantiated by accepted pain scales, (i.e., 80% pain reduction on the Visual Analog Scale), and improvement in function, similar injections should not be repeated.<br>
				Special Considerations:<br>
				For all injections (excluding trigger point and occipital nerve blocks) multi-planar fluoroscopy during procedures is required (except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used) to document technique and needle placement. All injections should be performed by a physician experienced in the procedure.<br>
				Permanent images are required to verify needle placement. The subspecialty disciplines of the physicians performing injections may be varied, including, but not limited to: anesthesiology, radiology, surgery, or physiatry. The practitioner should have completed fellowship training in pain medicine with interventional training, or its equivalent. They must also be knowledgeable in radiation safety.<br>
				Complications:<br>
				General complications of spinal injections may include transient neurapraxia, local pain, nerve injury, infection, headache, vasovagal effects. epidural hematoma, permanent neurologic damage, dural perforation and CSF leakage, and/or spinal meningeal abscess. More serious complications are rare but can include spinal cord damage; quadriplegia; permanent ataxia, and death. Injections at a C2-C3 level frequently cause temporary neuritis with ataxia. With steroid injections, there may be a dose dependent suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis lasting between one and three months.<br>
				Contraindications:<br>
				Absolute contraindications to therapeutic injections include: (a) bacterial infection – systemic or localized to region of injection, (b) bleeding diatheses, (c) hematological conditions, and (d) possible pregnancy.<br>
				Relative contraindications to diagnostic injections may include: allergy to contrast, poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension. Drugs affecting coagulation require restriction from use. The following are suggested time period restrictions:<br>
				Aspirin-withhold for seven days;<br>
				NSAIDs-withhold for three days;<br>
				Clopidogrel-withhold for 3 days;<br>
				Other anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulants should also be addressed individually by a knowledgeable specialist.<br><br>

				D.3.a.i Cervical Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI):<br>
				Description:<br>
				Cervical ESIs are injections of corticosteroid into the epidural space. The purpose of ESI is to reduce pain and inflammation in the acute or subacute phases of injury, restoring range-of-motion, and thereby, facilitating progress in more active treatment programs.<br>
				Needle placement: Multi-planar fluoroscopy is required for all epidural steroid injections, except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used. Contrast epidurograms allow one to verify the flow of medication into the epidural space. Permanent images are required to verify needle placement.<br>
				Recommendations:<br>
				Cervical ESIs are useful in patients with symptoms of cervical radicular pain syndromes.<br>	
				Epidural injections are not effective for cervical axial pain or non radicular pain syndromes and they are not recommended for this indication.<br>
				Time to Produce Effect: Local anesthetic, less than 30 minutes; corticosteroid, 48 to 72 hours for 80% of patients and 72 hours to 2 weeks for 20% of patients.<br>
				Frequency: One or more divided levels can be injected in one injection. If the first injection does not provide a diagnostic response with temporary and sustained pain relief (at least 2 to 6 weeks) substantiated by accepted pain scales (i.e., 80% pain reduction as measured by tools such as VAS), and improvement in function, repeat injections are not recommended.<br>
				Optimal Duration: Usually 1 to 3 injection(s), depending upon each patient’s response (improved functional gain and pain reduction).<br>
				Maximum Duration: 3 injections per spinal region may be done in one year depending upon patient’s response (improved functional gain and pain reduction). Patients should be reassessed after each injection for an 80% improvement in pain (as measured by accepted pain scales) and evidence of functional improvement.<br><br>

				A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
				The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.
				Medical Care<br>
				A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
				Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
				A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
				Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
				A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br>
				Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
				A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
				If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
				Treatment Approaches<br>
				A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
				Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
				Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br><br>

			D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES-NON-OPERATIVE <br>
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. <br>
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted.

Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. <br>
			Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. <br><br>

			D.6 INJECTION THERAPIES<br> 
			D.6.a Lumbar/Transforaminal/Epidural Injections<br> 
			Recommendations:<br> 
			Lumbar/Transforaminal/Epidural Injections must be fluoroscopically guided, except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used.<br> 
			D.6.a.i An epidural glucocorticosteroid injection is an option for acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes.<br> 
			Its purpose is a few weeks of partial pain relief while hopefully awaiting spontaneous improvement. An epidural steroid injection may provide short-term improvement, which may assist in successfully accruing sufficient time to ascertain whether conservative care will succeed.<br> 
			The term “option” in the paragraph above means there is no requirement that a patient receive and fail treatment with epidural glucocorticosteroids, especially repeated injections, prior to discectomy.<br>
			These injections must be fluoroscopically guided except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used.<br> 
			Frequency/Duration: It is recommended that each injection be scheduled separately, and effects of each injection be evaluated, depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction) rather than scheduling a “Series of 3.” Medications most often used in randomized controlled studies were triamcinolone and methylprednisolone combined with an anesthetic. The anesthetic has most often been bupivacaine. There are no head to head comparisons of different medications to ascertain the optimum medication(s) and/or dose(s).<br> 
			Maximum Duration: 3 injections may be done in one year depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction).<br> 
			Discontinuation: A second epidural steroid injection is not recommended if following the first injection there has been resolution of the symptoms of the acute radicular pain syndrome, particularly resolution of leg symptoms, or a decrease in symptoms to a tolerable level. If there has not been a response to a first epidural injection, there would be no recommendation for a second epidural injection, a 2nd injection is not recommended. In patients who respond with a pharmacologically appropriate 3 to 6 weeks of temporary, partial relief of leg pain, but who then have a worsening of leg pain and function, and who are not (yet) interested in surgical discectomy, a repeat epidural steroid injection is an option. Generally, there are not believed to be benefits beyond 3 injections for a given episode of radicular pain. Patients requesting a fourth injection should be counseled for discectomy, or considered to have chronic radicular symptoms for which epidural steroids are not recommended.<br> 
			D.6.a.ii Is an option for radicular pain syndromes lasting at least 3 weeks having been treated with NSAIDs and without evidence of trending towards spontaneous resolution.<br> 
			Consideration may also be given for an optional short course of an oral glucocorticosteroid before an injection.<br> 
			Frequency/Duration: Same as acute or subacute radicular pain above.<br> 
			Discontinuation: Same for acute or subacute radicular pain above.<br> 
			D.6.a.iii Epidural glucocorticosteroid injections are an option for second-line treatment for acute flare ups of spinal stenosis, although the evidence is less robust than it is for herniated discs.<br> 
			Frequency/Duration: It is recommended that each injection be scheduled, and the effects of each injection be evaluated depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction) before additional injections are considered, rather than scheduling a “Series of 3.”<br> 
			Maximum Duration: 3 injections may be done in one year depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction).<br> 
			Discontinuation: Resolution of the symptoms of spinal stenosis, or decrease in symptoms to a tolerable level.<br> 
			D.6.a.iv Is an option for symptoms of spinal stenosis of at least 1 to 2 months, with prior treatment that has included NSAIDs and progressive exercise.<br> 
			Frequency/Duration: It is recommended that each injection be scheduled, and the effects of each injection be evaluated depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction) before additional injections are considered, rather than scheduling a “Series of 3.”<br> 
			Maximum Duration: 3 injections may be done in one year depending upon patient response (improved function and pain reduction).<br> 
			Discontinuation: Resolution of the symptoms of spinal stenosis, or decrease in symptoms to a tolerable level.<br> 
			D.6.a.v Epidural glucocorticosteroid injections are not recommended for acute, subacute or chronic back pain in the absence of significant radicular symptoms.<br> 
			D.6.a.vi They are also not recommended as first or second line treatment in individuals with back pain symptoms that predominate over leg pain.<br>
			D.6.a.vii They are not recommended as treatment for any chronic back pain problem.<br><br>

			D.6.e Diagnostic Facet Joint Injections (Intra-articular and Nerve Blocks)<br> 
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.6.e.i One fluoroscopically guided (except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used) diagnostic facet joint injection, except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated (e.g. pregnancy) ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used, per side per level may be recommended for patients with chronic back pain that is significantly exacerbated by extension and rotation or associated with lumbar rigidity, and not alleviated with other conservative treatments (e.g., medication, aerobic exercise, other exercise, manipulation) in order to determine whether specific interventions targeting the facet joint are recommended. Repeated diagnostic injections in the same level(s) are not recommended.<br>
			Maximum Duration: One diagnostic facet joint injection per side per level, not to exceed two levels.<br> 
			D.6.e.ii Diagnostic facet joint injections are not recommended for acute, subacute back pain, or sciatic pain.<br><br> 

			D.6.f Therapeutic Facet Joint Injections<br> 
			Recommendations:<br>

				The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order:<br><br>

				D.3.a.ii Zygapophyseal (Facet) Injection<br>
				Zygapophyseal (Facet) injections must be fluoroscopically guided, except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated and ultrasound evaluation of needed placement may be used.<br>
				Description: Intra-articular or pericapsular injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid. There is no justification for a combined facet and medial branch block.<br>
				Recommendations:<br>
				Patients with pain 1) suspected to be facet in origin based on exam findings and 2) affecting activity; OR patients who have refused a rhizotomy; OR patients who have facet findings with a thoracic component. In these patients, facet injections may be occasionally useful in facilitating a functionally-directed rehabilitation program and to aid in identifying pain generators. Patients with recurrent pain should be evaluated with more definitive diagnostic injections, such as medial nerve branch injections, to determine the need for a rhizotomy. Because facet injections are not likely to produce long-term benefit by themselves and are not the most accurate diagnostic tool, they should not be performed at more than two levels. Therapeutic facet injections may be repeated if they result in increased documented functional benefit for at least 4 to 6 weeks and at least an 80% initial improvement in pain scales as measured by accepted pain scales (such as VAS).<br>	
				Time to Produce Effect: Up to 30 minutes for local anesthetic; corticosteroid up to 72 hours.<br>
				Frequency: 1 injection per side per level, not to exceed two levels with a diagnostic response. If the first injection does not provide a diagnostic response of temporary and sustained pain relief substantiated by accepted pain scales, (i.e., 80% pain reduction substantiated by tools such as VAS), and improvement in function, repeat injections are not recommended. At least 4 to 6 weeks of functional benefit should be obtained with each therapeutic injection.<br>
				Optimum Duration: 2 to 3 injections for each applicable joint per year. Not to exceed two joint levels depending upon patient’s response (improved functional gain and pain reduction).<br>
				Maximum Duration: 3 injections per application may be done in one year depending upon patient’s response (improved functional gain and pain reduction).<br><br>

				D.4 RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) MEDIAL BRANCH NEUROTOMY/FACET RHIZOTOMY<br>
				D.4.a.i Description:<br>
				A procedure designed to denervate the facet joint by ablating the corresponding sensory medial branches. Continuous percutaneous radio-frequency is the method generally used. There is good evidence to support this procedure in the cervical spine but benefits beyond one year are not yet established. Radio-frequency medial branch neurotomy is the procedure of choice over alcohol, phenol, or cryoablation. Precise positioning of the probe under fluoroscopic guidance is required since the maximum effective diameter of the device is a 5 x 8 millimeter oval. Permanent images should be recorded to verify placement of the device.<br>
				D.4.a.ii Recommendations:<br>
				Those patients with proven, significant, facetogenic pain. This procedure is not recommended for patients with multiple pain generators or involvement of more than 3 medial branch nerves.<br>
				Individuals should have met the following indications: pain of well-documented facet origin, unresponsive to active and/or passive therapy, manual therapy, and in which a psychosocial screening has been performed (e.g., pain diagram, thorough psychosocial history, screening questionnaire). It is generally recommended that this procedure not be performed until three months of active therapy and manual therapy have been completed.<br>	
				All patients should continue appropriate exercise with functionally directed rehabilitation. Active treatment, which patients will have had prior to the procedure, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered.<br>
				All patients should have a successful response to a diagnostic medial nerve branch block and a separate comparative block. To be a positive diagnostic block the patient should report a reduction of pain of 80% or greater from baseline for the length of time appropriate for the local anesthetic used.  In almost all cases this will mean a reduction of pain to 1 or 2 on the VAS 10-point scale correlated with functional improvement. The patient should also identify activities of daily living (which may include measurements of range-of-motion) that are impeded by their pain and can be observed to document functional improvement in the clinical setting. Ideally, these activities should be assessed throughout the observation period for function. The observer should not be the physician who performed the procedure.<br>
				A separate comparative block should be performed on a different date to confirm the level of involvement. A comparative block uses anesthetics with varying lengths of activity.<br><br>

				A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
				The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.
				Medical Care<br>
				A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
				Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
				A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
				Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
				A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br>
				Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
				A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
				If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
				Treatment Approaches<br>
				A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
				Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
				Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br><br>

			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.<br> 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br> 
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted.

			In unusual cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. <br><br>

			E.3 INJECTIONS-THERAPEUTIC<br> 
			Description: Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti-inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will: (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; (c) allow a break from pain; and (d) support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation program, they may be of significantly less value.<br> 
			Contraindications: General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may apply to individual injections.<br>

			D.4 RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) MEDIAL BRANCH NEUROTOMY/FACET RHIZOTOMY<br>
			D.4.a.i Description:<br>
			A procedure designed to denervate the facet joint by ablating the corresponding sensory medial branches. Continuous percutaneous radio-frequency is the method generally used. There is good evidence to support this procedure in the cervical spine but benefits beyond one year are not yet established. Radio-frequency medial branch neurotomy is the procedure of choice over alcohol, phenol, or cryoablation. Precise positioning of the probe under fluoroscopic guidance is required since the maximum effective diameter of the device is a 5 x 8 millimeter oval.

			A separate comparative block should be performed on a different date to confirm the level of involvement. A comparative block uses anesthetics with varying lengths of activity.<br>
			D.4.a.iii Complications:<br>
			Bleeding, infection, or neural injury. The clinician must be aware of the risk of developing a localized neuritis, and rarely, a deafferentation centralized pain syndrome as a complication of this and other neuroablative procedures.<br>
			D.4.a.iv Post-Procedure Therapy:<br>
			Active therapy. Implementation of a gentle reconditioning program within the first post-procedure week is recommended, barring complications. Instruction and participation in a long-term home-based program of range of motion, cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening, postural or neuromuscular reeducation, endurance, and stability exercises should be accomplished over a period of four to ten visits postprocedure.<br>
			D.4.a.v Requirements for repeat RF neurotomy (or additional level RF neurotomies):
			In some cases pain may recur. Successful rhizotomy usually provides from six to eighteen months of relief. Before a repeat RF neurotomy is done, a confirmatory medial branch injection should be performed if the patient’s pain pattern presents differently than in the initial evaluation. In occasional patients, additional levels of RF neurotomy may be necessary. The same indications and limitations apply.<br><br>

			D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES-NON-OPERATIVE <br>
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. <br>
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued. <br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
			Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. <br>
			Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. <br><br>

			D.6 INJECTION THERAPIES <br>
			D.6.h Sacroiliac Joint Injections<br>
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.6.h.i Sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections are recommended as a treatment option for patients with a specific cause of sacroiliitis, meaning a work-related aggravation of proven rheumatologic inflammatory arthritis involving the sacroiliac joints.<br> 
			D.6.h.ii Sacroiliac joint injections are recommended for the treatment of sacroiliac joint sprain/dysfunction.<br> 
			Sacroiliac sprain may present with local tenderness corresponding to the anatomical sacroiliac joint. Such presentation is an extra-axial finding, without radiation, and may be the result of inflammation or trauma. The pain may be acute, subacute or chronic.<br> 
			Frequency/Duration: If the results after the first injection are not satisfactory, fluoroscopic guidance must be used for the second injection except in cases where radiation exposure is contraindicated (e.g. pregnancy) ultrasound evaluation of needle placement may be used. Subsequent injections are not recommended unless significant improvement is noted after the initial injections.<br><br>
			
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES <br>
			The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines. <br>
			Medical Care <br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE <br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible. <br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES <br>
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses. <br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE <br>
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation. <br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
			Treatment Approaches <br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS <br>

			E.4 MEDICATIONS AND MEDICAL TREATMENT<br>
			E.4.d. Steroid Injections<br>
			Steroid injections may decrease inflammation and allow the therapist to progress with rehabilitation therapy. Steroid injections under significant pressure should be avoided as the needle may be penetrating the tendon and injection into the tendon can cause possible tendon breakdown, tendon degeneration, or rupture. Injections should be used with caution for patients under 30 years of age.<br>
			After steroid injections, some patients can have improved symptoms for one year.<br>
			Lower doses of steroids appear to be as effective as higher doses. There is good evidence that injections have better results at 3 months than oral steroids. If following the first injection, symptomatic relief is followed by recurrent symptoms, the decision to perform a second injection must be weighed against alternative treatments such as surgery. Surgery may give more definitive relief of symptoms.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 1 to 2 injections. If the first injection is unsuccessful and symptoms continue, the second injection should be performed by a specialist with expertise in the anatomy of the upper extremity.<br>
			-Maximum Frequency: 3 injections in one year.<br>
			Diabetics who are candidates for steroid injections should be counseled that a blood glucose increase may be apparent post-intervention, but effects should not last longer than approximately two days.<br><br>

			E.3 INJECTIONS-THERAPEUTIC<br> 
			Description: Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti-inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will: (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; (c) allow a break from pain; and (d) support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation program, they may be of significantly less value.<br> 
			Contraindications: General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may apply to individual injections.<br><br> 
			E.3.e Intra-Capsular Acid Salts<br> 
			Intra-Capsular Acid Salts (also known as Viscosupplementation) is a form of treatment for osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the knee joint. It is recommended that these injections be considered a therapeutic alternative in patients who have failed non-pharmacological and analgesic treatment, and particularly, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment is contraindicated or surgery is not an option. The utility of viscosupplementation in severe osteoarthritis and its efficacy beyond 6 months is not well known.<br> 
			Time to produce effect: One series of injections, per product instructions.<br> 
			Frequency: If the first use is associated with decreased symptoms and increased function, repeat use may be considered after 6 months if symptoms recur.<br> 
			Optimum/maximum duration: Varies. Efficacy beyond 6 months is not well known.<br><br>

			D.3 INJECTIONS: THERAPEUTIC<br>
			D.3.c Trigger Point Injections and Dry Needling Treatment<br>
			D.3.c.i Description:<br>
			Trigger point treatment can consist of dry needling or injection of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroid into highly localized, extremely sensitive bands of skeletal muscle fibers that produce local and referred pain when activated. Medication is injected in a four-quadrant manner in the area of maximum tenderness. Injection efficacy can be enhanced if injections are immediately followed by myofascial therapeutic interventions, such as vapo-coolant spray and stretch, ischemic pressure massage (myotherapy), specific soft tissue mobilization and physical modalities.<br>
			There is conflicting evidence regarding the benefit of trigger point injections. A truly blinded study comparing dry needle treatment of trigger points is not feasible.<br>
			There is no evidence that injection of medications improves the results of trigger-point injections. Needling alone may account for some of the therapeutic response. There is no indication for conscious sedation for patients receiving trigger point injections. The patient must be alert to help identify the site of the injection.<br>
			D.3.c.ii Recommendations:<br>
			Trigger point injections may be used to relieve myofascial pain and facilitate active therapy and stretching of the affected areas. They are to be used as an adjunctive treatment in combination with other treatment modalities such as functional restoration programs. Trigger point injections should be utilized primarily for the purpose of facilitating functional progress. Patients should continue in an aggressive aerobic and stretching therapeutic exercise program as tolerated throughout the time period they are undergoing intensive myofascial interventions. Myofascial pain is often associated with other underlying structural problems and any abnormalities need to be ruled out prior to injection. Trigger point injections are indicated in those patients where well circumscribed trigger points have been consistently observed, demonstrating a local twitch response, characteristic radiation of pain pattern and local autonomic reaction, such as persistent hyperemia following palpation. Generally, these injections are not necessary unless consistently observed trigger points are not responding to specific, noninvasive, myofascial interventions within approximately a 6-week time frame.<br>
			D.3.c.iii Complications:<br>
			Potential but rare complications of trigger point injections include infection, pneumothorax, anaphylaxis, neurapraxia, and neuropathy. Severe pain on injection suggests the possibility of an intraneural injection, and the needle should be immediately repositioned.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: Local anesthetic 30 minutes; no anesthetic 24 to 48 hours.<br>
			-Frequency: Weekly, suggest no more than 4 injection sites per session per week to avoid significant postinjection soreness.<br>
			-Optimal Duration: 4 Weeks.<br>
			-Maximum Duration: 8 weeks. On rare occasions additional treatments may be warranted.<br><br>

			D.6.d Tender and Trigger Point Injections<br>
			Recommendations:<br>
			D.6.d.i Trigger and/or tender point injections are not recommended for treatment of acute back pain. There are other more efficacious treatment strategies available.<br>
			D.6.d.ii Trigger or tender point injections may be reasonable second or tertiary options for subacute or chronic back pain that is not resolving with more conservative means (e.g., NSAID, progressive aerobic exercises, other exercises).<br>
			These injections are recommended to consist solely of a topical anesthetic (e.g., bupivacaine). Repeated injections should be linked to subjective and objective improvements. The use of therapeutic injections without participation in an active therapy program or in the context of maintaining employment is not recommended. An alternative option to these injections is acupuncture.
			-Frequency/Duration: It is recommended to allow at least 3 to 4 weeks between injections. If the results are not satisfactory after the first set of injections, a second set is reasonable. If there are not subjective and objective improvements at that point, further injections are not recommended.<br>

			E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, NON-OPERATIVE<br> 
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.<br> 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br> 
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms.<br>
			In unusual cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. <br><br>

			E.3 INJECTIONS-THERAPEUTIC<br> 
			Description: Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti-inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will: (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; (c) allow a break from pain; and (d) support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation program, they may be of significantly less value.<br> 
			Contraindications: General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may apply to individual injections.<br><br>
			E.3.b Trigger Point Injections<br>
			Not recommended.<br>

			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br><br>
