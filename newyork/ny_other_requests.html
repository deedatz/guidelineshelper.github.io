		<td>
		D.5 ELECTRICAL THERAPIES<br>

		<b>D.5.a Interferential Therapy</b><br> 
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.a.i Interferential therapy is not recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic back pain, chronic radicular pain syndromes, or other back-related conditions. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.b Transcutaneous Electrical Neurostimulation (TENS)</b><br>
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.b.i TENS is not recommended for acute back pain, subacute back pain, or acute radicular pain syndromes. <br>
		D.5.b.ii TENS is recommended for select use in chronic back pain or chronic radicular pain syndrome as an adjunct for more efficacious treatments. <br>
		TENS (single or dual channel) may be recommended as treatment for chronic back pain when clear objective and functional goals are being achieved, which includes reductions in medication use. TENS is used as adjunctive treatment in chronic pain conditions to support graded aerobic exercise and strengthening exercises. In those not involved in a conditioning program, or who are non-compliant with graded increases in activity levels, this intervention is not recommended. There is no quality evidence that more complex TENS units beyond the single or dual channel models are more efficacious, thus, those models are not recommended. <br>
		Frequency/Duration: TENS units should be tried prior to purchase to demonstrate efficacy and increase function. Two or three visits with a therapist may be necessary to instruct the patient in the application and use of the unit and to determine the most effective electrode placement and current parameters. <br>
		Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance or non-compliance, including non-compliance with aerobic and strengthening exercises. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.c Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS)</b><br> 
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.c.i PENS is not recommended for acute, subacute back pain or radicular pain syndromes. 
		D.5.c.ii As PENS is still an investigational treatment, it is not recommended outside of research settings for chronic non-radicular back pain. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.d Microcurrent Electrical Stimulation </b><br>
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.d.i Microcurrent electrical simulation is not recommended for acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndrome patients, as other therapies are believed to be more efficacious and less costly. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.e Electrical Nerve Block </b><br>
		Electrical Nerve Block (WCB) is not recommended. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.f Electrical Stimulation (Unattended) </b><br>
		Electrical Stimulation (unattended) (WCB) is not recommended. For the purposes of these guidelines, unattended means that the physician or therapist is not physically present with the patient on a 1:1 basis when treatment is being administered. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.g Transcutaneous Neurostimulator (TCNS) </b><br>
		TCNS (WCB) is not recommended. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.h H-Wave Stimulation </b><br>
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.h.i H-wave simulation is not recommended for acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndromes. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.i High-Voltage Galvanic</b><br> 
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.i.i High-voltage galvanic is not recommended for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndromes or other back-related conditions. <br><br>

		<b>D.5.j Iontophoresis </b><br>
		Recommendations: <br>
		D.5.j.i Iontophoresis is not recommended for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndromes or other back-related conditions. <br><br>

		<td>INTRAOPERATIVE MONITORING</td>
		<td>
		<b>E.7 INTRAOPERATIVE MONITORING</b><br>
		Intraoperative Monitoring is a common intraoperative electrodiagnostic technique that may include somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), motor evoked potentials (MEP), or pedicle screw monitoring. The monitoring procedure may be used to evaluate spinal cord integrity and screw placement during the operative procedure. The use of intraoperative monitoring can be anticipated to become more common as percutaneous spinal procedures gain greater acceptance.<br>

		<td>TENS (Neck)</td>
		<td>
		<b>D.11.o Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</b><br>
		Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) treatment should include at least one instructional session for proper application and use. Indications include muscle spasm, atrophy and control of concomitant pain in the office setting. Minimal TENS unit parameters should include pulse rate, pulse width and amplitude modulation. Consistent, measurable, functional improvement must be documented and a determination made of the likelihood of chronicity prior to the provision of a home unit. TENS treatment should be used in conjunction with active physical therapy.<br>
		Time to Produce Effect: Immediate.<br>
		Frequency: Variable.<br>
		Optimum Duration: 3 sessions.<br>
		Maximum Duration: 3 sessions. Purchase or provide with home unit if effective.<br>

		<th>General Guidelines</th>
		<tr>
			<td>
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br> 
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br> 
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains that can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures that can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br> 
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br> 
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
			Time Frames <br>
			A.7 TREATMENT TIME FRAMES <br>
			Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatment is initiated, not on the date of injury. Obviously, duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. <br> 
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
			Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
			A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM<br>
			Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br>
			Return to Work<br> 
			A.17 FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY EVALUATION (FCE)<br> 
			Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range-of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular profile/aerobic capacity; (c) coordination; (d) lift/carrying analysis; (e) job-specific activity tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non-material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors.<br> 
			In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE.<br> 
			A.18 RETURN TO WORK<br> 
			For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care, should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan, and is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries given the poor return to work prognosis for a patient who has been out of work for more than six months.<br><br>
