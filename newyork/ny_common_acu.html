				New York Neck Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012<br> 
				<br>	
				D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE<br>
				Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br>
				Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
				Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
				Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. <br>
				Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone.<br>	
				The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order:<br><br>

				D.1 ACUPUNCTURE<br>
				Acupuncture is a procedure used for the relief of pain and inflammation, and there is some scientific evidence to support its use. The exact mode of action is only partially understood. Western medicine studies suggest that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system at the level of the brain, promotes deep relaxation, and affects the release of neurotransmitters. Acupuncture is commonly used as an alternative or in addition to traditional Western pharmaceuticals. While it is commonly used when pain medication is reduced or not tolerated, it may be used as an adjunct to physical rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention to hasten the return of functional activity. Moxibustion and other complementary integrative medicine techniques are often combined with acupuncture, but have no demonstrated efficacy. No additional reimbursement should be provided for acupuncture combined with moxibustion or other similar adjunctive procedures. Acupuncture must be performed by a professional who is authorized under the Workers' Compensation Laws and duly certified in New York State to provide acupuncture services.<br>
				Acupuncture (With or Without Electrical Stimulation): is the insertion and removal of filiform needles to stimulate acupoints (acupuncture points), with or without the use of electrical current (micro-amperage or milliamperage) on the needles at the acupuncture site. Needles may be inserted, manipulated and retained for a period of time. Acupuncture can be used to reduce pain, reduce inflammation, increase blood flow, increase range of motion, decrease the side effect of medication-induced nausea, promote relaxation in an anxious patient, and reduce muscle spasm. Indications include joint pain, joint stiffness, soft tissue pain and inflammation, paresthesia, post-surgical pain relief, muscle spasm, and scar tissue pain.<br>
				Time to produce effect: 3 to 6 treatments.<br>
				Frequency: 1 to 3 times per week.<br>
				Optimum duration: 1 month.<br>
				Maximum duration: 10 treatments.<br>
				Total Time Frames for Acupuncture and Acupuncture with Electrical Stimulation: Time frames are not meant to be applied to each of the above sections separately. The time frames are to be applied to all acupuncture treatments regardless of the type or combination of therapies being provided.<br>
				Acupuncture treatments may extend longer if objective functional gains can be documented or when symptomatic benefits facilitate progression in the patient’s treatment program. Treatment beyond 10 treatments must be documented with respect to need and ability to facilitate positive symptomatic or functional gains.<br><br>
				
				A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
				The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.
				Medical Care<br>
				A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
				Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
				A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
				Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
				A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br>
				Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
				A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
				If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
				Treatment Approaches<br>
				A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
				Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
				Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
				A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM<br>
				Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			New York Mid and Low Back Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012 <br><br>
			D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES-NON-OPERATIVE <br>
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. <br>

			Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. <br><br>
			
			D.1 ACUPUNTURE<br>
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.1.a.i Routine use of acupuncture is not recommended for acute, subacute back pain, radicular pain. Although it is not high cost and its use is not associated with high potential for patient harm, it is not recommended.<br>
			D.1.a.ii Acupuncture is recommended for select use in chronic back pain as an adjunct to more efficacious treatments.<br>
			D.1.a.iii Acupuncture may be recommended as treatment of chronic back pain as a limited course during which time there are clear objective and functional goals that are to be achieved.<br>
			Consideration for time-limited use in chronic back pain patients without underlying serious pathology is as an adjunct to a conditioning program that has both graded aerobic exercise and strengthening exercises. Acupuncture is only recommended to assist in increasing functional activity levels more rapidly and the primary attention should remain on the conditioning program.<br>
			This intervention is not recommended for patients not involved in a conditioning program, or who are non-compliant with graded increases in activity levels.<br>
			Frequency/Duration:<br>
			a. There are different patterns which are used in quality studies. These range from weekly for a month to 20 appointments over 6 months; however the norm is generally no more than 8 to 12 sessions.<br>
			b. An initial trial of 5 to 6 appointments would appear reasonable in combination with a conditioning program of aerobic and strengthening exercises.<br>
			c. Future appointments should be tied to improvements in objective measures and would justify an additional 6 sessions, for a total of 12 sessions.<br>
			Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance, or non compliance, including non-compliance with aerobic and strengthening exercises.<br><br>

			E NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT PROCEDURES<br>
			E.4.e. Therapy: Active<br>
			The following active therapies are widely used and accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. They are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and alleviating discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task, and thus assists in developing skills promoting independence to allow self-care after discharge. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual, and/or tactile instructions. At times a provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to complete the task is predominately executed by the patient.<br>
			Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Follow-up visits to reinforce and monitor progress and proper technique are recommended. Home exercise can include exercise with or without mechanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. The following active therapies and modalities are listed in alphabetical order.<br><br>

			E.4.f. Therapy: Passive<br> 
			Most of the following passive therapies and modalities are generally well-accepted methods of care for a variety of work-related injuries. These include treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and swelling to improve the rate of healing soft tissue injuries. They should be used in adjunct with active therapies to help control swelling, pain, and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. They may be used intermittently as a therapist deems appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment.<br><br>

			E.4.f.i Acupuncture: There is some evidence that acupuncture may be effective in symptom relief. No studies have demonstrated long-term functional benefit. This treatment may be used in conjunction with an active therapy program for non-surgical patients who do not improve with splinting and activity modification. It is not known if there are any long-term deleterious neurological effects from acupuncture.<br> 
			Optimum duration: limited to 10 sessions over 5 weeks.<br><br> 

			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br> 
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br> 
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains that can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures that can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br> 
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br> 
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
