				New York Neck Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines, Second Edition, October 1, 2012<br> 
				<br>	
				D THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: NON-OPERATIVE<br>
				Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer, and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the patient. First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified or restricted duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br>
				Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
				Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms. <br>
				Lastly, for those patients who fail to make expected progress 6-12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. <br>
				Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. Home therapy is an important component of therapy and may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone.<br>	
				The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order:<br><br>

				<b>D.7 ORTHOTICS</b><br>
				Primary principles and objectives of the application of cervical orthosis include: (a) control of the position through the use of control forces; (b) application of corrective forces to abnormal curvatures; (c) aid in spinal stability when soft tissues or osteoligamentous structures cannot sufficiently perform their role as spinal stabilizers; and (d) restrict spinal segment movement after acute trauma or surgical procedure. In cases of traumatic cervical injury, the most important objective is the protection of the spinal cord and nerve root.<br><br>

				<b>D.7.a Cervical Collars</b><br>
				D.7.a.i Soft Collars are well-tolerated by most patients but may not significantly restrict motion in any plane and are associated with delayed recovery. There is no evidence that their use promotes recovery from cervical sprain. In acute strain/sprain type injuries, use of cervical collars may prolong disability, limit early mobilization, promote psychological dependence, and limit self-activity. There is some evidence that patients encouraged to continue usual activity have less neck stiffness and headache than patients placed in cervical collars following motor vehicle crashes. Their use, therefore, is not recommended.<br>
				D.7.a.ii Rigid Collars, such as a Philadelphia Orthosis, are useful post-operative or in emergency situations. These collars restrict flexion and extension motion, and to a lesser degree lateral bending and rotation. Duration of wear post-surgery is dependent upon the physician and degree of cervical healing, but is generally not used beyond 8 weeks.<br><br>

				<b>D.7.b Posture Appliances</b><br>
				Posture Appliances such as the Miami brace restrict flexion and extension motion to about the same degree as a Philadelphia collar, and to a greater degree, lateral bending and rotation. Not recommended in sprain or strain injuries.<br><br>

				<b>D.7.c Cervicothoracic Orthosis</b><br>
				Cervicothoracic Orthosis such as Yale and sternal occipital mandibular immobilization (SOMI) type braces, restrict flexion and extension motion to a fuller degree than the Philadelphia collar and to a better degree lateral bending and rotation. Not recommended in sprain or strain type injuries.<br><br>

				<b>D.7.d Halo Devices</b><br>
				Halo Devices are used in the treatment of cervical fracture, dislocation, and instability at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Refer to Halo Immobilization in the Operative Therapeutic Procedures Section.<br><br>

				<b>D.7.e Other Orthoses, Devices and Equipment</b><br>
				Special orthoses or equipment may have a role in the rehabilitation of a cervical injury such as those injuries to a cervical nerve root resulting in upper extremity weakness or a spinal cord injury with some degree of paraparesis or tetraparesis. Use of such devices would be in a structured rehabilitation setting as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program.
				<br><br>
				A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
				The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.
				Medical Care<br>
				A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
				Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
				A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
				Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
				A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br>
				Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
				A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT <br>
				If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. <br>
				Treatment Approaches<br>
				A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS<br>
				Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses.<br>
				Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
				A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAM<br>
				Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			<b>D.2 APPLIANCES</b><br> 
			Include: shoe insoles, shoe lifts, kinesiotaping and taping, lumbar supports, magnets, mattresses and sleeping surfaces.<br> <br>

			<b>D.2.a Shoe Insoles and Shoe Lifts</b><br>
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.2.a.i These interventions are recommended for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic back pain or radicular pain syndrome in the presence of significant leg length discrepancy. <br>
			In the absence of significant leg length discrepancy, these are not recommended. <br><br>

			<b>D.2.b Kinesiotaping, Taping or Strapping </b><br>
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.2.b.i Other than for acute joint immobilization (for example, acute ankle sprain), kinesiotaping, taping or strapping are not recommended for acute, subacute or chronic pain.<br><br>

			<b>D.2.c Lumbar Supports</b><br> 
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.2.c.i Lumbar supports may be useful for specific treatment of spondylolisthesis, documented instability, or post-operative treatment. 
			D.2.c.ii Lumbar supports are not recommended for the prevention or treatment of other back pain conditions.<br> <br>

			<b>D.2.d Magnets</b><br> 
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.2.d.i The use of magnets is not recommended.<br><br> 

			<b>D.2.e Mattresses, Water Beds, and Sleeping Surfaces (None with Sciatica)</b><br> 
			Recommendations:<br> 
			D.2.e.i It is recommended that patients select mattresses, pillows, bedding, or other sleeping options that are most comfortable for them. <br>
			D.2.e.ii There is no recommendation regarding mattresses other than that providers should be aware that ordering patients to sleep on firm mattresses or on the floor may be incorrect. <br>
			D.2.e.iii There is no quality evidence to guide recommendations regarding other optimal sleeping surfaces (e.g., bedding, water beds, and hammocks). <br><br>

			D SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES, TESTING AND TREATMENT PROCEDURES<br>
			<b>D.1 ACROMIOCLAVICULAR (AC) JOINT SPRAINS/DISLOCATIONS</b><br>
			D.1.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (AC Joint Sprains/Dislocations)<br>
			D.1.e.iv Physical medicine interventions should emphasize a progressive increase in range of motion without exacerbation of the AC joint injury. With increasing motion and pain control, a strengthening program should be instituted and a return to modified/limited duty would be considered at this time. By 8-11 weeks, with restoration of full or near-full motion, return to full duty should be anticipated.<br><br>
			<b>D.2 ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS/FROZEN SHOULDER DISORDER</b><br>
			D.2.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder)<br>
			Non-Operative Treatment Procedures address the goal to restore and maintain function and may include:<br>
			D.2.e.i Physical medicine interventions are the mainstay of treatment and may include thermal treatment, ultrasound, TENS, manual therapy, and passive and active range-of-motion exercises; as the patient progresses, strengthening exercises should be included in the exercise regimen.<br><br>
			<b>D.3 BICIPITAL TENDON DISORDERS</b><br>
			D.3.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders)<br>
			D.3.e.iii Physical medicine and rehabilitation interventions should emphasize a progressive increase in range of motion. With increasing motion and pain control, a strengthening program should be instituted and return to modified/limited duty would be considered at this time. By 8-11 weeks, with restoration of full motion, return to full duty should be anticipated.<br><br>
			<b>D.4 BRACHIOPLEXUS INJURIES</b><br>
			D.4.a Brachial Plexus<br>
			D.4.a.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Brachial Plexus):<br>
			(b) Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.
			D.4.b Axillary Nerve<br>
			D.4.b.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Axillary Nerve):<br>
			Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.<br>
			D.4.c Long Thoracic Nerve<br>
			D.4.c.v Non-Operative Treatment (Long Thoracic Nerve):<br>
			(a) Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.<br>
			D.4.d Musculocutaneous Nerve<br>
			D.4.d.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Musculocutaneous Nerve):<br>
			(a) Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.<br>
			D.4.e Spinal Accessory Nerve<br>

			D.4.f.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Suprascapular Nerve)<br>
			(a) Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.5 BURSITIS OF THE SHOULDER</b><br>
			D.5.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Bursitis of the Shoulder)<br>
			D.5.e.i Benefits may be achieved through non-operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation and work station, thermal therapy, and ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate.<br>
			D.5.e.ii May return to work without overhead activities and lifting with involved arm until cleared by physician for those and heavier activities.<br>
			D.5.e.iii Additional modalities/treatment procedures may include physical medicine and rehabilitation including instruction in therapeutic exercise, proper work technique and manual therapy; vocational rehabilitation, vocational assessment and interdisciplinary team approach. Biofeedback is not recommended.<br><br>
			<b>D.6 IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME</b><br>
			D.6.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Impingement Syndrome)<br>
			Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include:<br>
			D.6.e.iv Non-Operative Treatment Procedures, such as relative rest, immobilization, thermal treatment, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise and physical medicine and rehabilitation should be considered.<br><br>
			<b>D.7 ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</b><br>
			D.7.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tear)<br>
			D.7.e.ii Relative rest and non-operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation/work station, thermal treatment, and therapeutic ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate. If no clinically significant increase in function for a partial- or full-thickness tear is observed after adequate participation in a rehabilitation program, a surgical consultation is indicated. Adequate is here defined as at least 75% attendance in an active physical therapy program with a minimum of 2-3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. A physical therapy program that is based solely on passive modalities, or for which the claimant has not demonstrated compliance is insufficient. Early surgical intervention produces better surgical outcome due to healthier tissues and often less limitation of movement prior to and after surgery.<br><br>
			<b>D.8 ROTATOR CUFF TENDINITIS</b><br>
			D.8.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Rotator Cuff Tendinitis)<br>
			Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include:<br>
			D.8.e.iii Non-operative treatment procedures/modalities such as relative rest, immobilization, thermal treatment, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise, physical medicine and rehabilitation should be limited to the first 2-3 weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort, and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate.<br><br>
			<b>D.9 SHOULDER FRACTURES</b><br>
			There are five common types of shoulder fractures. Each type will be addressed separately and in the order of most frequent occurrence.<br>
			<b>D.9.a Clavicular Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.a.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Clavicular Fracture)<br>
			(a) Most are adequately managed by closed techniques and do not require surgery. After reduction, the arm is immobilized in a sling or figure-8 bandage.<br>
			Shoulder rehabilitation is begun with pendulum exercises 10-14 days after injury. Subsequently, with pain control, the therapy program can be progressed with non-operative therapeutic approaches.<br><br> 
			<b>D.9.b Proximal Humeral Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.b.v Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative (Proximal Humeral Fracture)<br>
			(g) Shoulder rehabilitation is begun with pendulum exercises 10-14 days after injury. Subsequently, with pain control, the therapy program can be progressed with therapeutic approaches noted in Section E, Non-Operative Treatment Procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.c Humeral Shaft Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.c.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Humeral Shaft Fracture)<br>	
			(a) Most isolated humeral shaft fractures can be managed non-operatively.<br>
			(d) At 2-3 weeks after injury, a humeral fracture orthosis may be used to allow for full elbow motion.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.d Scapular Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.d.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Scapular Fracture)<br>
			(a) Non-displaced acromial, coracoid, glenoid, glenoid neck and scapular body fractures may all be treated with the use of a shoulder immobilizer.
			 (c) Pendulum exercises may be started within the first week.<br>
			(d) Progress to assisted range of motion exercises at 3-4 weeks using appropriate therapeutic procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.9.e Sternoclavicular Dislocation/Fracture</b><br>
			D.9.e.v Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative (Sternoclavicular Dislocation /Fracture) <br>
			 (b) Immobilize with a sling for 3-4 weeks.<br>
			Subsequently, further rehabilitation may be utilized using procedures set forth in Section E, Nonoperative Treatment Procedures.<br><br>
			<b>D.10 SHOULDER INSTABILITY</b><br>
			D.10.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (Shoulder Instability)<br>
			Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation<br>
			D.10.e.ii Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques<br><br>
			<b>D.11 SUPERIOR LABRUM ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR (SLAP) LESIONS</b><br>
			D.11.d Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (SLAP Lesion)<br>
			Most SLAP lesions are associated with other pathology such as rotator cuff tears, Bankart lesions, joint instability, biceps tendon tears, and supraspinatus tears. The provider should refer to the treatment protocols for these conditions and follow both the surgical and non-surgical recommendations. For suspected isolated SLAP lesions, non-invasive care, consider the following.<br>
			D.11.d.iii Benefits may be achieved through therapeutic rehabilitation and rehabilitation interventions. They should include range-of-motion (ROM), active therapies, and a home exercise program. Passive as well as active therapies may be used for control of pain and swelling. Therapy should progress to strengthening and an independent home exercise program targeted to further improve ROM and strength of the shoulder girdle musculature.<br><br>
			<b>E.2 IMMOBILIZATION</b><br>
			Time is dependent upon type of injury, then progress with muscle girdle strengthening.<br>
			Time to produce effect: 1 day.<br>
			Frequency: Once.<br>
			Optimum duration: 1 week.<br>
			Maximum duration: 12 weeks.<br>
			The arm is immobilized in a sling for 1-12 weeks post-injury, depending upon the age of the patient. The patient is instructed in isometric exercises while in the sling for the internal and external rotators and the deltoid.<br><br>

			<b>E.2.a Kinesiotaping, Taping or Strapping</b><br>
			Other than for acute joint immobilization (for example, acute ankle sprain), kinesiotaping, taping or strapping are not recommended for acute, subacute or chronic pain.<br><br>

			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE <br>
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured.

Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br>
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter.

			Active and/or passive therapy, bracing, orthotics, therapeutic injections. <br><br>
			<b>D.11 TENDINITIS/TENOSYNOVITIS</b><br> 
			D.11.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, including ergonomic changes at work station(s), NSAIDs, therapeutic injections. <br><br>
			<b>D.12 BURSITIS</b><br>
			D.12.e Non-Operative Treatment <br>
			Active and/or passive therapy, ice, therapeutic injection, treatment of an underlying infection, if present. <br><br>
			E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, NON-OPERATIVE<br> 
			Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker.<br> 
			First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time.<br> 
			Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued.<br>
			Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms.<br>
			In unusual cases where a patient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. <br><br>
			<b>E.5 ORTHOTICS AND PROSTHETICS</b><br> 
			E.5.a Fabrication/Modification of Orthotics <br>
			Fabrication/Modification of Orthotics would be used when there is need to normalize weight-bearing, facilitate better motion response, stabilize a joint with insufficient muscle or proprioceptive/reflex competencies, to protect subacute conditions as needed during movement, and correct biomechanical problems.<br> 
			Time to produce effect: 1 to 3 sessions (includes wearing schedule evaluation). <br>
			Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week.  <br>
			Optimum/maximum duration: 4 sessions of evaluation, casting, fitting, and re-evaluation. <br>

			<b>E.5.b Orthotic/Prosthetic Training </b><br>
			Orthotic/Prosthetic Training is the skilled instruction (preferably by qualified providers) in the proper use of orthotic devices and/or prosthetic limbs including stump preparation, donning and doffing limbs, instruction in wearing schedule and orthotic/prosthetic maintenance training. Training can include gait, mobility, transfer and self-care techniques. <br>
			Time to produce effect: 2 to 6 sessions. <br>
			Frequency: 3 times per week. <br>
			Optimum/maximum duration: 2 to 4 months. <br>

			<b>E.5.c Splints or Adaptive Equipment </b><br>
			Design, fabrication and/or modification indications include the need to control neurological and orthopedic injuries for reduced stress during functional activities and modify tasks through instruction in the use of a device or physical modification of a device, which reduces stress on the injury. Equipment should improve safety and reduce risk of re-injury. This includes high and low technology assistive options such as workplace modifications, computer interface or seating, crutch or walker training, and self-care aids. <br>
			Time to produce effect: Immediate. <br>
			Frequency: 1 to 3 sessions or as indicated to establish independent use. <br>
			Optimum/maximum duration: 1 to 3 sessions. <br><br>

			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
			A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS
			Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains.<br>
			A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAMS<br>
			Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings.<br><br>

			E NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT PROCEDURES<br>
			<b>E.4.c. Orthotics/Immobilization with Splinting</b><br> 
			There is some evidence that splinting leads to more improvement in symptoms and hand function than watchful waiting alone. Because of limited patient compliance with day and night splinting in published studies, evidence of effectiveness is limited to nocturnal splinting. Splints should be loose and soft enough to maintain comfort while supporting the wrist in a relatively neutral position. This can be accomplished by using a soft or rigid splint with a metal or plastic support. Some splints include immobilization of the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. Splint comfort is critical and may affect compliance. Off-the-shelf splints are usually sufficient, although custom thermoplastic splints may provide a better fit for certain patients. <br>
			Splints may be effective when worn during sleep hours or during portions of the day, depending on activities. Most studies show that full-time night splinting for a total of 4 to 6 weeks is the most effective protocol. Depending on job activities, intermittent daytime splinting can also be helpful. Splint use is rarely mandatory. Providers should be aware that over-usage is counterproductive, and should counsel patients to avoid over-usage.<br> 
			Splinting is generally effective for milder cases of CTS. Long-term benefit beyond 3 months has not been established. An effect should be seen in 1 to 4 weeks. Splinting is more likely to have some long-term benefit in patients who have less severe paresthesias and pain during sleep hours (less than 6/10) and who have had symptoms for less than 1 year.<br>
			-Time to Produce Effect: 1 to 4 weeks. If after 4 weeks the patient has partial improvement, continue to follow since neuropathy may worsen even in the face of diminished symptoms. <br>
			-Frequency: During sleep hours. Daytime intermittent, depending on symptoms and activities. <br>
			-Optimum Duration: 4 to 8 weeks. <br>
			-Maximum Duration: 2 to 4 months. If symptoms persist, consideration should be given to either repeating electrodiagnostic studies or to more aggressive treatment. <br><br>
			<b>F.3 POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT</b><br>
			<b>F.3.b. Mobilization</b><br>
			There is some evidence showing that immediate mobilization of the wrist following surgery is associated with less scar pain, and faster return to work. Final decisions regarding the need for postoperative splinting should be left to the discretion of the treating physician based upon the surgical technique used and the specific conditions of the patient.<br><br>
			A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br> 
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE<br> 
			Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains that can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures that can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation.<br> 
			A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT<br> 
			If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention.<br>
