	<b>E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES: OPERATIVE</b><br>
	All operative interventions should be based on a positive correlation with clinical findings, the natural history of the disease, the clinical course, and diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors should have led to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of the pathologic condition(s). It is imperative for the clinician to rule out non-physiologic modifiers of pain presentation, or non-operative conditions mimicking radiculopathy or instability (peripheral compressive neuropathy, chronic soft tissue injuries, and psychological conditions), prior to consideration of elective surgical intervention. Early intervention may be required in acute incapacitating pain or in the presence of progressive neurological deficits. Patients who are not candidates for or refuse surgical treatment should be treated with non-operative therapy as indicated.<br>
	If a non-operative treatment approach is initially recommended, surgery may be indicated after the failure of conservative management. The patient must continue to exhibit the designated objective findings, subjective symptoms and (where applicable) imaging findings.<br> 
	Operative treatment is indicated when the natural history of surgically treated lesions is better than the natural history for non-operatively treated lesions. All patients being considered for surgical intervention should first undergo a comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal examination to identify mechanical pain generators that may respond to non-surgical techniques, or may be refractory to surgical intervention. <br> 
	In situations requiring the possible need for re-surgery, a second opinion may be necessary. Psychological evaluation is strongly encouraged when surgery is being performed for isolated axial pain to determine if the patient will likely benefit from the treatment.<br>
	Interdisciplinary interventions should be strongly considered post-operatively in patients not making functional progress within expected time frames. Return to work activity restrictions should be specific. Most cervical non-fusion surgical patients can return to a limited level of duty between 3 to 6 weeks. Full activity is generally achieved between 6 weeks to 6 months, depending on the procedure and healing of the individual.<br><br>
	<b>E.1 ACUTE FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS</b><br>
	Decisions regarding the need for surgery in acute traumatic injury will depend on the specific injury type and possibility of long-term neurologic damage. Acute disc herniations may occur in the presence of traumatic injury.<br>
	<b>E.1.a Halo Immobilization</b><br>
	E.1.a.i Description: Intervention that restricts flexion-extension motion. Halo vest will provide significant but not complete rotational control and is the most effective device for treating unstable injuries to the cervical spine.<br>
	E.1.a.ii Complications: May include pin infection, pin loosening, and palsy of the sixth cranial nerve.<br>
	E.1.a.iii Surgical Indications: Cervical fractures requiring the need for nearly complete restriction of rotational control, and to prevent graft dislodgment, spine mal-alignment, or pseudarthrosis. Decision for use of halo is at the discretion of the surgeon based upon the patients' specific injury. Not indicated for unstable skull fractures or if skin overlying pin sites is traumatized.<br>
	E.1.a.iv Operative Treatment: Placement of the pins and apparatus.<br>
	E.1.a.v Post-Operative Therapy: Traction may be required for re-alignment and or fracture reduction (amount to be determined by surgeon), active and/or passive therapy, pin care.<br><br>
	<b>E.1.b Anterior or Posterior Decompression with Fusion</b><br>
	E.1.b.i Description: To provide relief of pressure on the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots, and alignment and stabilization of the spine. May involve the use of bone grafts, sometimes combined with metal devices, to produce a rigid connection between two or more adjacent vertebrae.<br> 
	E.1.b.ii Complications: Instrumentation failure such as screw loosening, plate failure, or dislodgement (more common in posterior instrumentation), bone graft donor site pain, in-hospital mortality, deep wound infection, superficial infection, graft extrusion, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, laryngeal nerve damage (anterior approach), and iatrogenic kyphosis.<br>
	E.1.b.iii Surgical Indications: When a significant or progressive neurological deficit exists in the presence of spinal canal compromise. Whether early decompression and reduction of neural structures enhances neurological recovery continues to be debated. Currently, a reasonable approach would be to treat non-progressive neurological deficits on a semi-urgent basis, when the patient's systemic condition is medically stable.<br> 
	E.1.b.iv Operative Treatment: Both anterior and posterior surgical decompression of the cervical spine are widely accepted. The approach is guided by location of the compressive pathology as well as the presence of other concomitant injuries. Posterior stabilization and fusion alone may be indicated for patients who have been realigned with traction and do not have significant canal compromise. The anterior approach is acceptable if there is disc and/or vertebral body anteriorly compromising the canal. The posterior approach may be indicated in radiculopathy in the absence of myelopathy and with evidence of pseudarthrosis on radiographs, or if the compression pathology is arising posteriorly. The number of levels involved in the fracture pattern determines the choice between the use of wire techniques versus spinal plates. In injuries treated with an anterior decompression procedure, anterior bone grafting alone does not provide immediate internal fixation and an anterior cervical plate is significantly beneficial. Patients who undergo surgery for significant fracture dislocations of the spine (three-level injury) with canal compromise are best managed with anterior cervical decompression, fusion, and plating but in some cases posterior stabilization and fusion are also considered.<br>
	E.1.b.v Post-Operative Treatment: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6-12 weeks with fusion). Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program, with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening, and restoration of range of motion, is appropriate once the fusion is solid and without complication. New techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. Active treatment, which patients should have had prior to surgery, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
	<b>E.2 DISC HERNIATION AND OTHER CERVICAL CONDITIONS</b><br>
	Operative treatment is indicated only when the natural history of an operatively treatable problem is better than the natural history of the problem without operative treatment. All patients being considered for surgical intervention should undergo a comprehensive neuromuscular examination to identify pain generators that may respond to nonsurgical techniques or may be refractory to surgical intervention. Timely decision making for operative intervention is critical to avoid deconditioning, and increased disability of the cervical spine.<br>
	General Recommendations: There is some evidence to suggest that recovery from cervical radiculopathy in patients without clinical signs of spinal cord compression at one year is similar with one-level fusion, physical therapy, or rigid cervical collar use. For patients with whiplash injury (Quebec Classification Grade Levels I or II), there is no evidence of any beneficial effect of operative treatment.<br>
	If cervical fusion is being considered, it is recommended that the patient refrain from smoking for at least six weeks prior to surgery and during the time of healing. Because smokers have a higher risk of non-union and higher post-operative costs, it is recommended that insurers cover a smoking cessation program peri-operatively.<br>
	General Indications for Surgery: Operative intervention should be considered and a consultation obtained when improvement of symptoms has plateaued and the residual symptoms of pain and functional disability are unacceptable at the end of six weeks of treatment, or at the end of longer duration of non-operative intervention for debilitated patients with complex problems. Choice of hardware instrumentation is based on anatomy, the patient's pathology, and surgeon's experience and preference.<br>
	E.2.a Specific Indications<br>
	Specific Indications include:<br>
	E.2.a.i For Patients with Myelopathy immediate surgical evaluation and treatment is indicated.<br>
	E.2.a.ii For Patients with Cervical Radiculopathy.<br>
	Early intervention may be required for acute incapacitating pain or in the presence of progressive neurological deficits. Persistent or recurrent arm pain with functional limitations, unresponsive to conservative treatment after six weeks; or Progressive functional neurological deficit; or Static neurological deficit associated with significant radicular pain; and confirmatory imaging studies consistent with clinical findings.<br>
	E.2.a.iii For Patients with persistent non-radicular cervical Pain:<br>
	While cervical fusion is appropriate treatment for neck pain due to degeneration with radiculopathy, there is no evidence that cervical fusion for neck pain alone produces results superior to conservative care. In the absence of a radiculopathy, it is recommended that a decisive commitment to surgical or nonsurgical interventions not be made within 4 to 5 months following injury. The effectiveness of cervical vertebral fusion for non-radicular pain has not been established. Therefore, it should not be routinely recommended. In patients with non-radicular cervical pain for whom fusion is being considered, required pre-operative indications include all of the following:<br>
	In general, if the program of non-operative treatment fails, operative treatment is indicated when:<br>
	Improvement of the symptoms has plateaued, and the residual symptoms of pain and functional disability are unacceptable at the end of 6 to 12 weeks of active treatment, or at the end of longer duration of non-operative programs for debilitated patients with complex problems; and/or<br>
	Frequent recurrences of symptoms cause serious functional limitations even if a non-operative active treatment program provides satisfactory relief ofsymptoms, and restoration of function on each recurrence.<br>
	Mere passage of time with poorly guided treatment is not considered an active treatment program.<br>
	All pain generators are adequately defined and treated; and<br>
	All physical medicine and manual therapy interventions are completed; and<br>
	X-ray, MRI, or CT/discography demonstrating disc pathology or spinal instability; and<br>
	Spine pathology limited to two levels; and<br>
	Psychosocial evaluation for confounding issues addressed.<br>
	For any potential surgery, it is recommended that the patient refrain from smoking for at least six weeks prior to surgery and during the period of healing. Because smokers have a higher risk of non-union and higher post-operative costs, it is recommended that insurers cover a smoking cessation program perioperatively.<br><br>
	<b>E.2.b Surgical Procedures<br></b>
	Surgical Procedures include:<br>
	<b>E.2.b.i Cervical Discectomy with or without Fusion:</b><br>
	Description: Procedure to relieve pressure on one or more nerve roots or spinal cord. It may be performed with or without the use of a microscope.<br>
	Complications: May include strut graft dislodgment (multi-level decompression), infection, hemorrhage, CSF leak, hematoma, catastrophic spinal cord injury causing varying degrees of paralysis, pseudarthrosis, in-hospital<br>
	mortality, non-union of fusion, donor site pain (autograft only). Anterior approach: permanent or transient dysphonia, permanent or transitory dysphagia, denervation, esophageal perforation, and airway obstruction.<br>
	Surgical Indications: Radiculopathy from ruptured disc or spondylosis, spinal instability, or patients with nonradicular neck pain meeting fusion criteria. There is no evidence that discectomy with fusion versus discectomy without fusion has superior long-term results. Discectomy alone is generally considered in patients with pure radicular symptoms from their herniated disc and who have sufficiently large foramena that disc space collapse is unlikely to further compromise the nerve root. Failure rates increase with disease at more than two levels.<br>
	Operative Treatment: Cervical plating may be used to prevent graft dislodgment especially for multi-level disease.<br>
	Post-Operative Therapy: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6 - 12 weeks with fusion). Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program, with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening and restoration of ROM is appropriate, once fusion is solid and without complication. New techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. Active treatment, which patients should have had prior to surgery, will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
	<b>E.2.b.ii Cervical Corpectomy:</b><br>
	Description: Removal of a portion or the entire vertebral body from the front of the spine. May also include removal of the adjacent discs. Usually involves fusion.<br>
	Complications: May include strut graft dislodgment (multi-level decompression), infection, hemorrhage, CSF leak, hematoma, catastrophic spinal cord injury causing varying degrees of paralysis, pseudarthrosis, in-hospital mortality, non-union of fusion, donor site pain (autograft only). Anterior approach: permanent or transient dysphonia, permanent or transitory dysphagia, denervation, esophageal perforation, and airway obstruction.<br>
	Surgical Indications: Single or two-level spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or severe kyphosis, with cord compression.<br> 	
	Operative Treatment: Neural decompression, fusion with instrumentation, or halo vest placement to maintain cervical position. Hemicorpectomy may be done when only a portion of the vertebral body needs to be resected. Allografts may be used for single bone graft fusion; however, autografts are generally preferable for multi-level fusions unless a large strut graft is required. Post-Operative Therapy: Dependent upon number of vertebral bodies involved, healing time may be longer than discectomy. Halo vest care has traditionally been required, but new techniques in cervical fusion with instrumentation may permit more rapid mobilization. Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening is appropriate for most patients once the cervical spine is deemed stable and without complication. Newer surgical techniques may permit earlier referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
	<b>E.2.b.iii Cervical Laminectomy with or without Foraminotomy or Fusion:</b><br>
	Description: Surgical removal of the posterior portion of a vertebra in order to gain access to the spinal cord or nerve roots.
	Complications: May include perineural fibrosis, kyphosis in fractures without fusion or with failed fusion, nerve injury, post surgical instability (with foraminotomies), CSF leak, infection, non-union of fusion, donor site pain (autograft only).</b>
	Surgical Indications: Neural compression.<br>
	Operative Treatment: Laminotomy, partial discectomy, and nerve root decompression.<br>
	Post-Operative Therapy: Cervical bracing may be appropriate (usually 6 to 12 weeks with fusion), although newer surgical techniques may not require prolonged immobilization. Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and a daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening and restoration of range of motion is appropriate for most patients once the cervical spine is deemed stable and without complication. Newer surgical techniques may permit earlier referral to a rehabilitation program, and the decision regarding timing should be left to the surgeon. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a long-term home-based exercise program.<br><br>
	<b>E.2.b.iv Cervical Laminoplasty:</b><br>
	Description: Technique that increases anterior or posterior dimensions of the spinal canal while leaving posterior elements partially intact. It may be performed with or without the use of a microscope.<br>
	Complications: Loss of cervical motion, especially extension.<br>	
	Surgical Indications: Multi-level disease: cervical spinal stenosis or spondylitic myelopathy. Not indicated in cervical kyphosis.<br>
	Operative Treatment: Posterior approach, with or without instrumentation.<br>
	Post-Operative Therapy: May include 4 to 12 weeks of cervical bracing. Home programs with instruction in ADLs, sitting, posture, and daily walking program should be an early part of the rehabilitation process. Referral to a formal rehabilitation program with emphasis on cervical, scapular, and thoracic strengthening and restoration of range of motion is appropriate once the cervical spine is stable and without complication. Active treatment which patients should have had prior to surgery will frequently require a repeat of the sessions previously ordered. The goals of the therapy program should include instruction in a longterm, home-based exercise program.<br><br>
	<b>E.2.b.v Percutaneous Discectomy:</b><br>
	Description: An invasive operative procedure to accomplish partial removal of the disc through a needle which allows aspiration of a portion of the disc trocar under imaging control.<br>  
	Complications: Include, but are not limited to, injuries to the nerve or vessel, infection, and hematoma.<br> 
	Surgical Indications: Percutaneous discectomy is indicated only in cases of suspected septic discitis in order to obtain diagnostic tissue. The procedure is not recommended for contained disc herniations or bulges with associated radiculopathy due to lack of evidence to support long-term improvement.<br>
	Operative Treatment: Partial discectomy.<br><br>
	<b>E.3 ELECTRICAL BONE GROWTH STIMULATORS</b><br>
	Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators are not included on the list of preauthorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure.<br>
	Recommendations<br>
	E.3.a.i Non invasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery for those at high risk for pseudoarthrosis, including one or more of the following fusion failure risk factors:<br>
	1) One or more previous failed spinal fusion(s)<br>
	2) Grade II or worse spondylolisthesis<br>
	3) Fusion to be performed at more than one level<br>
	4) Presence of other risk factors that may contribute to non-healing:<br>
	Current smoking<br>
	Diabetes<br>
	Renal disease<br>
	Other metabolic diseases where bone healing is likely to be compromised (e.g.: significant osteoporosis)<br>
	Active alcoholism<br>
	Morbid obesity BMI >40<br>
	E.3.a.ii Non-invasive Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators may be considered as treatment for individuals with failed spinal fusion. Failed spinal fusion is defined as a spinal fusion that has not healed at a minimum of 6 months after the original surgery, as evidenced by serial x-rays over a course of 3 months during the latter portion of the 6 month period.<br><br>
	<b>E.4 ARTIFICIAL CERVICAL DISC REPLACEMENT</b><br>
	Artificial Disc Replacement is not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure.<br>
	Artificial Cervical Disc Replacement involves the insertion of a prosthetic device into the cervical intervertebral space with the goal of permitting physiologic motion at the treated cervical segment. If cervical disc replacement is to be used, the most current FDA guidelines must be followed. The following criteria must be met:<br>
	1. Skeletally mature patient without renal failure, severe diabetes, osteoporosis, severe spondylosis, severe facet pathology, cervical instability, localized fracture, or localized or systemic infections.<br>
	AND<br>
	2. Single-level disc degeneration of C3 to C7 confirmed by imaging studies such as CT or MRI, with one of the following diagnoses:<br>
	-Herniated disc; or<br>
	-Osteophyte formation; or<br>
	-Loss of disc height<br>
	AND<br>
	3. The patient must present with symptoms, which must correspond with the planned level of disc replacement:<br>
	-Intractable radiculopathy (nerve root compression) and/or myelopathy (functional disturbance or pathological change in the spinal cord) causing radicular pain in the upper extremity; or<br>
	-Functional and/or neurological deficit.<br>
	AND<br>
	4. Six weeks of non-operative alternative treatments have failed. These treatments may include physical therapy, medications, braces, chiropractic care, bed rest, spinal injections or exercise programs. Documentation of treatments and failure to improve is required.<br>
	The disc must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All other artificial disc systems are considered experimental and investigational.<br>
	All other indications, including multilevel degenerative discdisease, are considered experimental and investigational.<br>
	Artificial disc replacement is NOT recommended under the following conditions, since safety and effectiveness of the replacement discs has not been established for patients with:<br>
	Previous surgical intervention at the involved level;<br>
	Prior or proposed fusion at an adjacent cervical level;<br>
	More than one cervical level requiring artificial disc replacement;<br>
	Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the affected level due to current or past trauma (including but not limited to the radiographic appearance of fracture callus, malunion or nonunion).<br>
	Active systemic infection or infection at the operating site;<br>
	Allergy to titanium, polyurethane, or ethylene oxide residues;<br>
	Osteoporosis defined as a DEXA bone mineral density Tscore equal to or worse than -2.5;<br>
	Moderate to advanced spondylosis characterized by bridging osteophytes, marked reduction or absence of motion, or collapse of the intervertebral disc space of greater than 50% of its normal height;<br>
	Marked cervical instability on radiographs (e.g., radiographic signs of subluxation greater than 3.5 mm or angulation of the disc space more than 11 degrees greater than adjacent segments);<br>
	Significant cervical anatomical deformity or compromised vertebral bodies at the index level (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or compromise due to current or past trauma);<br>
	Significant kyphotic deformity or significant reversal of lordosis; or<br>
	Symptoms necessitating surgical treatment at more than one cervical level.<br><br>
	<b>E.5 PERCUTANEOUS RADIOFREQUENCY DISC DECOMPRESSION</b><br>
	Percutaneous Radiofrequency Disc Decompression of the cervical spine is an investigational procedure. There have been no randomized clinical trials of this procedure at this time. It is not recommended.<br><br>
