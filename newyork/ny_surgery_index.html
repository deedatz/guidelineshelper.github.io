			<h4>A GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES</h4>
			<p>The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines.<br>
			Medical Care<br>
			A.1 MEDICAL CARE<br>
			Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work-related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient’s daily and work activities and return to work, while striving to restore the patient’s health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.<br>
			A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
			Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work-related injuries and or illnesses.<br>
			Treatment Approaches<br>
			A.13 SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS<br>
			Contemplation of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of "cure" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat severe pain, there should be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause.
