	F SURGERY <br>
	F.1. SURGICAL INDICATIONS/CONSIDERATIONS<br> 
	Surgical management of CTS should not preclude the treatment of other upper extremity conditions as indicated. Overall it is probably reasonable to expect that 40 to 50% of patients with mild exam findings may improve or remain stable over time without surgery. <br>
	There is strong evidence that surgery is more effective than splinting or injections in producing long-term symptom relief and normalization of median nerve conduction velocity for those patients with clinically significant CTS with positive NCV findings. There is also a positive cost utility for surgery over conservative care for patients with positive nerve conduction studies. There is good evidence that surgery improves symptoms more effectively than steroid injection for up to five months. 
	In one prospective study, duration of symptoms prior to surgery, up to five years, did not affect the ability to achieve symptom or functional outcome <br>
	success with surgery. Patients with more severe symptoms and longer duration of symptoms showed significant improvement with surgery. Patients with thenar atrophy, weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis, and fixed sensory deficits may still improve with surgery. Patients with mild symptoms and functional deficits demonstrated the smallest changes from pre- to postoperative scores. However, their postoperative scores were higher than the postoperative scores of those with more severe symptoms. <br><br>

	F.1.a. Surgery as Initial Therapy <br>
	Surgery should be considered an initial therapy in situations where clinical evidence of CTS is present based on the criteria below.<br> 
	1. Median nerve trauma has occurred: “acute carpal tunnel syndrome,” or <br>
	2. Thenar atrophy is present and due to median nerve compression, or <br>
	3. Electrodiagnostic evidence of moderate to severe compressive neuropathy of the median nerve is present. EMG findings showing evidence of acute or chronic motor denervation suggest the possibility that irreversible damage may be occurring. There is good evidence that surgery is more beneficial than non-surgical treatment for patients with a motor latency of more than 5.0 ms. 
	For cases with positive EDX findings (see D.3.a.ii) and with a motor latency less than 5.0 ms, non-surgical treatment may be beneficial in some cases; therefore, conservative management, including job alterations, should be tried over 4 to 6 weeks before surgery is considered. <br><br>

	F.1.b. EDX Studies <br>
	A clinical impression of moderate to severe CTS with normal EDX studies is very rare and generally indicates a mistaken diagnosis. <br>
	• Surgery is generally not recommended in these cases. <br>
	• Surgery may be considered in cases where a clinical impression of moderate-to-severe CTS exists, electrodiagnostic testing is normal, and initial non-operative therapy as recommended by these guidelines has failed. The following criteria must be met in deciding whether to proceed to surgery in these cases:<br>
	1. The patient’s medical history, including symptoms and physical examination findings are specific for clinically-significant CTS (moderate-to-severe). and <br>
	2. There has been no benefit from previous non-operative treatment as described in the current guidelines. and <br>
	3. The patient experiences a significant temporary relief following steroid injection into the carpal tunnel.<br> <br>

	F.2 OPERATIVE PROCEDURES <br>

	F.2.a. Techniques <br>
	Endoscopic and open carpal tunnel release have low rates of serious complications. The most commonly seen serious complications are incomplete transection of the transverse carpal ligament and inadvertent nerve or vessel injuries. Choice of technique should be left to the discretion of the surgeon. <br>
	F.2.a.i Neurolysis: Has not been proven advantageous for CTS. Internal neurolysis should never be done. Very few indications exist for external neurolysis. <br><br>

	F.2.a.ii Tenosynovectomy: <br>
	• For routine cases of CTS, tenosynovectomy has not proven to be of benefit, and is not recommended. 
	• Tenosynovectomy may be considered at the time of carpal tunnel release in the unusual case in which CTS is accompanied by rheumatoid arthritis. <br>
