	D.1 CHONDRAL DEFECTS (Cartilage or Cartilage and Bone Defects) <br>
	D.1.a Description/Definition <br>
	Cartilage or cartilage and bone defect at the articular or meniscal surface of a joint. <br>
	D.1.f Surgical Indications/Operative Treatment <br>
	Osteochondral Autograft and Autologous Chrondrocyte Implantation (ACI) are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre-authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Refer to Table 3 for criteria. <br>
	If a non-operative treatment approach is initially recommended, surgery may be indicated after the failure of conservative management. The patient must continue to exhibit the designated objective findings, subjective symptoms and (where applicable) imaging findings. Refer to Table 3. <br>
	D.1.g Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) Exclusion Criteria <br>
	ACI is not a covered procedure in any of the following circumstances: <br>
	Lesion that involves any portion of the patellofemoral articular cartilage, bone, or is due to osteochondritis dissecans. 
	A “kissing lesion” or Modified Outerbridge Grade II, III, or IV exists on the opposite tibial surface. <br>
	Mild to severe localized or diffuse arthritic condition that appears on standing x-ray as joint space narrowing, osteophytes, or changes in the underlying bone. <br>
	Unhealthy cartilage border; the synovial membrane in the joint may be used as a substitute border for up to ¼ of the total circumference. <br>
	Prior total meniscectomy of either compartment in the affected knee. Must have at least 1/3 of the posterior meniscal rim. 
	History of anaphylaxis to gentamycin or sensitivity to materials of bovine origin. 
	Chondrocalcinosis is diagnosed during the cell culture process. <br>

	Table 2: Modified Outerbridge Classification <br>
	I - Articular cartilage softening<br>
	II - Chondral fissures or fibrillation < 1.25 cm in diameter<br>
